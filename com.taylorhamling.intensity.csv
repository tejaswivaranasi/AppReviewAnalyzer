com.taylorhamling.intensity,OO7R3N7,"Best one on the market bar none, and that's after trying 3 other big ones. No more using notes or a Google spreadsheet. Recommended this to a few guys at the gym too. Download it, you won't regret it - and you can export your data too if you're worried!",5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Richard Smith,"For the most part this is comparable to a straight forward workout tracking/logging app. that I used to use and was great (Redy Gym Log), but is no longer available. Just one particular function that falls short though is the ""Exercise Search"". Why the whole list of them is completely scrambled and not in alphabetical order is very frustrating and makes it hard to find them. A simple change/update on this and I will not hesitate to give this 5 stars.",3

This app has the best stat tracking mechanism to implement ""Beating The Log Book"" method. - Can track max reps done at particular weight - Max weight done at particular rep range - e1Rm and much more! Really multiple ways to keep tracking your progress and motivate yourself to push a bit further each session!",5

Despite the app name, can't actually calculate your relative intensity, only training volume. Gives you a little cup reward for overhead pressing 50 kg for 1 even though you did 50 for 8 a month ago, but see, you never did for 1 before. Makes sense, ok.",2

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Lasse Keronen,If it would be reliable at keeping my logged data correct it would be a five star app. Unfortunately it is not. The developer is friendly and responsive but unfortunately bugs that mess the log data for whatever reason makes using the app quite difficult. Other popular apps don't have these reliability related problems so I'm forced to switch over.,2
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Karrthik Srigandan,"Import / export CSV functionality, weight progression options, good exercise database. Having some issues with Google fit sync and figuring out supersets but this should come with time and doesn't really detract from overall app functionality. Update 61221: The idea behind this app is great but frustrating bugs inc disappearing historical data for lifts and current lifts, I've had to switch apps. Developer is responsive but for cost and lack of update since Jan 21 not worth the premium paid.",2

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Rafa≈Ç Tarka,"It would've been such a great app if it actually had some kind of exercises list management. Right now there are no categories, no pictures, you can't define new exercises on your own, you can't change the order or even name of the existing ones - these are pretty basic features in most other workout apps. Look, no one will search for exercises by names out of 7500 different items - I've no idea how half of them are called even in my native language, yet here I need to know their English names.",3

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Ryan Coolman,Love it! Use it every time I go to the gym. Makes it so much easier to track progress,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Thomas Robertson,The best workout tracker I've ever used.,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Jake Miller,The purpose of this app is 100% effective. Do you 5*5? This will track. Do you smolov? This will track and calculate the weights for you? Do you write your stuff in a notebook? This will track 90% but does randomly unselect completed sets...hence 4*. But all in all I'll probably buy premium as a thank you.,4
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Mohammad Felemban,It started really good but after the 8th week I am facing a bug in which the application does not reset my daily volume For each workout... Please fix it üôèüèΩ this is lounge of my favourites workout apps,4

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Denis Bensch,Great app üëå,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Jesus Herrera,Having a way to record RPE is the killer feature. Very user friendly. I would also like a way to record RPE with less clicks and visualize RPE in the set rows (next to reps and weight column).,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Michael Whalon,"Amazing app, as a developer in an unrelated tech stack, I can say this gives me all the stats and tracking that I love. The premade programs are easy to alter and track with. I would like a button to press when the workout is completed though, because that would give me serotonin",5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Johannes Botha,Great app for powerlifting training.,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Kyle Goodwin,"A great deal of potential but definitely lacking with no support. I bought the premium to see if that would actually get the devs to listen or respond. Nope. Frankly the paid version is NOT worth it. The app has some frustrating bugs. Also, it's nice that users can add an exercise but there is no regulating of them. So there are a ton of duplicates and misspellings. The ability to extract data is the only reason I keep using this. Edit: this app has gotten worse. Don't bother installing.",2
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Austen Zentner,"Very nice app. Works great for tracking progress, makes progressive overload programs a snap to use! Only thing that would be nice is to make a movement unilateral on the app rather than tracking two sets (ex. for left and right), and if you could add ""notes"" to all sets at once (ex, 'blood flow restriction band on quads') however I'm really just being nit-picky at this point. Great app!",5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Abdullah Alamri,"Great app! It helps improving very much, one question though, can I add a time exercise? For example, if I am ganna do plank, can I add a one set with one repetition for specified time? If no, please add this feature, thanks.",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,April Diss,"This is very user friendly. I do still carry my notebook to keep track because I'm not seeing how it gives a progression, so I can see my regime. It would also be helpful if it would sync with other apps besides google fit.",4

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Bailey Harris,"After using other workout tracking apps, I've got to hand it to Intensity for making me realise I've been robbing myself of the full workout tracking experience all these years.

com.taylorhamling.intensity,rachel massey,"New to the app and discovering things that make it super user friendly with every workout! Ability to edit reps/weights + apply to all sets, even retroactively. Ability to measure in KG or lbs and ability to convert workouts into one or the other. Ability to add from diary, without having to go into the exercise. Etc etc etc! Will keep using for sure. Might even try to enter my training notebook from the past 30 days to see what the pie charts would look like. I think this is pretty f'in neat.",5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,Ben Legg,"Honestly, this is the best session tracker I've ever used. Easy to navigate, easy to use and I love being able to edit really minor details set by set such as RPE, set type, adding notes etc. The option to view the loading of plates based on weight you've input is such a nice touch",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Samuel Stephen,"A great idea, tries to be in-depth. Unfortunately, falls prey to US antihuman 'full spectrum dominance' hacking in nearly every single function of the app. This is unavoidable until we as a species legalize androids, and force US criminals to face justice. Even if it worked right, the paid version seems expensive. Seriously, 18$ for dark theme? It could use more expansion, a calendar, more modes catering to hypertrophy, etc.",2
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Jeremy Belter,I love that you can track and add your own workouts,5

Reply to Dev : My phone warned me twice that the app was draining my battery. I never started the timer or inputted anything into the app. I opened it, closed it, and eventually deleted it.",1
com.taylorhamling.intensity,Jan Capetanopulos (InvestOrPerish),It's an app developed by a powerlifting programmer. The free version is more fleshed out than some pro version apps I've used... What else do you need to know lol,5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,Awesome list of programs,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Good app for tracking workouts. They have a few good programs to load. Only downside is the ability to alter the days of the program, or maybe I just haven't figured it out yet.",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,Awesome app. Being able to view your history on every exercise makes selecting weight and tracking progress super simple.,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Looks great at first, a bit odd at first but it's great that it has so many powerlifting programs that I'm interested in. Looking forward to see how it goes.",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,Loses my trackings and progress multiple times...,3
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"I WANT A REFUND. This app is full of frustrating bugs! Adding custom workouts to diary, buggy. Using the workout pool feature- buggy. Adding more than 9 reps to an exercise= they show up in random numbers in the real workout (usually 3 reps). Same with sets. Can't delete the workouts if you add the pool feature,must delete each exercise seperately if wanting to switch workout days. This app should not have a premium option until the bugs are worked out!",1

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Horrible experience. Wish i could rate as a 0 because of the experience. Only thing denoting that you need premium to save your program is a little crown to the left of the submit button when you are actively creating a program (which is neither accessible for low vision users or those with visual disabilities). And you cant save the form you have filled out as a draft for later. So, lost the entire workout i created. That screen should not be accessible until you buy premium.",1

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Brilliant, free version is amazing so good it made me want to buy premium 1. For the features 2. To reward the developer for such a helpful app.",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,Its great for creating a program to follow for each gum session as well as tracking 1rm and having all the weights calculated for you.,5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,Helpful,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"I was expecting a simple strength app like big lifts pro, but this was in my opinion unnecessary complex in comparison.",2
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,best app I've used for tracking workouts and progress. Tracks progress incredibly well. Very useful. The only thing that could be improved is being able to add Supersets and dropsets into the workout. Otherwise A+,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,Great programs for all athletes,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"So far so good following the Jeff nippard plan. Takes a bit of time at 1st to work out your one rep maxes, After that it's a breeze to work. Just an update.

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Simple, easy, and everything you need to workout (beginner or advanced).",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,A really good tool for logging in your lifts. My only gripe is that the timer countdown must be set up each time you do a different movement or session. I would hope that it can be permanently set for future uses.,4
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Everything useful for powerlifting in a single app! Edit: after using premium for close to a year now, have to say definitely worth it! It would be nice to have the circles for the sets show the number of reps, instead of the simple tick. Kinda like how the amrap sets show 'A'. Cheers!",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Too many apps missing actual workout volume. This is the first one I've seen that actually makes sure you know how much you're currently doing vs how much you did previously. Allowing you to properly track.

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"I like this app because it's just a good log. The charts are a little much, and I don't really use them. I haven't tried any of the programs, but I'm sure they're fine. The log worked for the program I was on at the time, so the built-in ones should be the same.",4
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Fantastic app for planning and tracking workouts. Really like the ability to add pre-set programs, which I have done for Smolov and Smolov Jr. Would like the ability to change the ""rounding"" after a program is already added to the diary, as any changes to the 1rm appears to remove any rounding previously set. Also, there appears to be an error in week 9 day 1 of smolov - I think the final set is supposed to be 1x5@85%, not 90%.",5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"I wanted to love it...but in the end the complexity of the app and all the extra steps you had to go thru to do simple things did me in. Instead of ""adding to diary"" then going to diary, opening program, enter in first week and begin...just ""start program"" would've been great. I did want to love it, but setting up, differentiating sets, reps and programs and otherwise functionality just wasnt quite there.

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Developer has tracked down my email and started sending me essays about how his app works and he wants me to talk to him. Creepy and weird.  Logged me out mid-workout, presumably to invite me to log in with FB, stopped displaying my workout history when I tried to log back in with or without FB. Developer claims the data isn't lost, it's just an internet connection issue... which means nothing when the app stops displaying it mid workout. I won't risk another workout to the app flaking no matter what the cause. 0/10 do not recommend. Have switched to google doc to track current lifts.

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"I really like this app. I've used a different one for years, and this one has some of the features the other one was missing. Having popular programs is a bonus. it would be nice if the app calculated you lift weights based on 1RM and 90% 1RM instead of doing just ""bench press, 5 sets of 10 at 60%"" having it come out as ""...5 sets of 10 at 165lb""",5

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,very well constructed app and very helpful - a useful suggestion would be too maybe make scale of rpe slide larger to allow ppl to program lower weights by rpe for injury recovery and very low intensity work,5

Ideally you'd be able to set a bodyweight % per exercise (for push ups etc.), and set negative weight for reps to subtract from bodyweight (pull up bands etc.)",5

bottom of the screen. Its difficult to e.g. enter # of reps since the field 
is small, same problem with the button. Also it accidentally makes me tap 
the home button on my phone. Also a 'notes' option would be nice, to add 
details about an exercise (hand position etc).",4

However I would like to change days training but the feature to do so 
doesn't work even though I'm premium user I can't modify wourkoutplans. 
Minor problem but I like having my calendar in order :-) Edit: gave it 4 
stars before but after mailing the developer who quickly responded and who 
did a specific workout plan for the changes I needed I give it 5 stars. 
Great app. If you are serious with strength training this is it. Especially 
since the developer seems going the extra mile for his customers. :-)",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"Stumbled across this app after spending hours creating my own excel sheet 
to log my progress. It's simple, minimalistic, and has enough tools for 90% 
of the things powerlifters want. I like it, and no other app has come close 
to what I've been trying to envision in my head for tracking lifting stats. 
Excellent work for a solo developer Now, on to some constructive criticism. 
I found some of the icons a bit confusing. I think the 3 dots in the top 
right should be replaced with a toolbox icon of some kind, because that's 
exactly what it is. Reviewing the stats screen on the mobile app is a 
little finicky because you have to select individual exercises from a drop 
down menu. I'm sure there's a better way to present the info, but I can't 
think of it right now. But it's a bit frustrating because the exercises 
have no priority. So if I've been doing a large variety of exercises, the 
ones I really care about can get lost in the mix. A possible fix would be 
to be able to ""star"" or ""favourite"" exercises and that will bump those 
exercises to the top of any list they're in, including the diary and 
programs. Probably much easier said than done. Another feature that would 
be nice to have is the incorporation of more stats and metrics. Next to the 
graph of bodyweight, you could toss in things like weight change over last 
week or month or 3 month period. Autoregulation is the flavour of the 
moment, and its great that RPE is in the app. You could probably play with 
that and be able to provide a few metrics like RPE change over a set. Refer 
to RTS' Trac for more ideas, since they are the leader in that. Trac also 
has a way of monitoring daily fatigue, so you may want to allow for those 
kinds of metrics as well. Things like daily resting heart rate, grip 
strength and a subjective 1-10 general fatigue score may be useful metrics 
for stat nuts like me. The hard part after that is organising the data 
presentation in a way that isn't messy. Sorry for the rant. It's an awesome 
app, I'll probably buy the lifetime premium when I've properly adapted to 
it.",5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,Best powerlifting programs I've seen,5
com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"The app is actually incredible. It does everything that a great lifting 
tracking app should do. It's amazing how few apps allow the ability to add 
separate weeks for programs. A lot of programs change week to week, and 
most apps don't accommodate this. The reason for the 3 star rating is the 
payment system. There needs to be a one time purchase option. Even if it is 
$10 or $15, that would be preferable to $4.50 a month. Please consider 
offering a lifetime subscription and I will purchase immediately.",3

com.taylorhamling.intensity,A Google user,"I had really high hopes for this app.  I LOVE that it has a number of programs built in.  However, editing a session or changing the weight for a single set is cumbersome.  It would be nice to be able to just tap on the set and adjust the weight lifted there instead of having to delete the exercise and start over on it.   The app also tends to lag if I try to add a program from the desktop dashboard and then use the app.  The app has great potential, but it's not usable enough for me right now.",3

Knowing my deadlift volume overall is great, but that circular meter per workout pushes me to fill out all the way and beat the previous workout.
