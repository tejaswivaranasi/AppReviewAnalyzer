workout.progression.lite,Leaving Scotland,The stats page is hidden behind a paywall.,1
workout.progression.lite,Eternity Prevails,This app is not intuitive or easy to use,2
workout.progression.lite,Dalil Elbazzaz,"Hi, the app is almost perfect for me. I do have one annoying thing. When the alarm of the timer goed off and phone is not on standby the volume will be set lower of my music and I can not put the music volume up again. Pretty hard to explain. Am I the only one?",4
workout.progression.lite,David Cunningham,Just download and try. If you intend to get strong then it really is worth the effort to move your thumb over install,5
workout.progression.lite,Anton Wenemoser,The app isn't that great anymore. It would be way better to have animations/drawings for the most common excersises.,5
workout.progression.lite,Daniel Felipe Gil Gamboa,"100$ are way too much in my country, I'm from latam. I only want to create a custom program and export to csv but that price is too much... :(",1
workout.progression.lite,Massimo,The app is basic but has everything you need to record your session and keep track of your progress. Also the developer (Zoltan) is always willing to help and to give you a quick feedback if needed.,5
workout.progression.lite,Robi Dani,100 dollars? No thanks,1
workout.progression.lite,Nokin,"It's a very good app to track your progress. But if we had the option to create our own workouts, it would be very nice because some exercises are not in the app.",5
workout.progression.lite,william y karen Ortega,Does the developer really think this app is worth almost 100U$? It is not bad as app but i am sorry I remove it right away because of the price. Please be reasonable some apps like Fit on has trainers and it cost way way less. Nice app but sorry about the pricing i hope this comment help the developers to remain in the game.,2
workout.progression.lite,Mamad del Rosario,Simple and very easy to use,5
workout.progression.lite,Omari Blackman,Great app. Been using it for about 5 years. Have loads of data on my progression;). Some updates have not been as smooth as others but the app more than makes up for it.,5
workout.progression.lite,Damon Leavitt,Adding exercises used to be easy on this app. Now it's so glitchy using paper is the better option. It adds multiples of the same exercise and you can't get rid of the extras. I'm giving it a three because it used to be a great app.,3
workout.progression.lite,Michael Hughes,Great app for tracking and planning workouts,5
workout.progression.lite,Michael Soto,"Great simple tracking, no ads",5
workout.progression.lite,John Christensen,Easy to use app with all the features I want in my workout app. Developer is very responsive and helpful with any issues I've had.,5
workout.progression.lite,Walter Luigi,Great app. Just wish it had a way to log RPE/RIR for my work sets. If it's there I haven't found it yet.,4
workout.progression.lite,Michael May,Great. Wish there was an ios version too.,5
workout.progression.lite,BeastOfNature,"Great app as a whole. But there are one or two things that bother me. First is the exercise search. If I want to search for incline dumbbell bench press, typing in ""dumbell incline"" returns no results, but ""Incline dumbbell"" does. This leads to me thinking the app doesn't have the exercise just because I didn't type it out exactly how the app has it. Secondly is support for warm up sets and RPE and %1RM would be great.",4
workout.progression.lite,Megan Kennington,"Download this if you would like to lose all your data and workouts. I was a big fan before upgrade, paid for premium, but am unable to resync anything for some reason... It's not worth setting everything up again honestly",1
workout.progression.lite,Aaron Hohlt,Best workout tracking app,5
workout.progression.lite,Craig Neu,"Used to be a simple if slightly buggy fitness tracker, very feature-scarce but I didn't mind that. I paid a small fee to unlock it and was happy with the barebones experience because it was all I needed. Now, the dev has locked basic features behind a costly subscription, a laughable proposition considering how lackluster the app is and likely will continue to be. Avoid, there are much better options out there. Reddit recommends FitNotes.",1
workout.progression.lite,Jay Taylor,Thanks for all the updates!! The best weight lifting trackers and more!!!,5
workout.progression.lite,Eric Grossman,"I love every aspect of this app. It has effective design, intuitive controls for logging data, extensive catalogs of exercises that are easy to navigate, and every tool needed — from a plate calculator to a stopwatch. It's impressive when an app has so much capability, yet is still easy to use. Great work.",5
workout.progression.lite,Jamie Thompson,Another great update - already the best workout tracker on the app store!,5
workout.progression.lite,James I,I love this app - nothing comes close in my opinion. Just one thing - during a workout I will use the notes or comments feature and refer back to it for my next workout..but how do I view these? If I go to 'history' and then click on the workout I can't see any notes. How can I view these?,5
workout.progression.lite,Hrvoje Dokoza,"Looking for an app that has almost everything? Look no more. I've been using this app for the last five years. Today, for the first time, I had a problem. Zoltan responded immediately and solved the problem in no time. I've also tried much more expensive apps on the market, but none compare to Progression. Some small things are missing, such as calendar view, and a few other little things, but the app is worth the investment.",5
workout.progression.lite,Hbmonkey9,Been using this app for years.. They removed a bunch of features and hid them behind a monthly subscription. Don't recommend this app anymore moving to Strong.,1
workout.progression.lite,Bupé,"Ahhh man they messed it up 😩😩 I used to be a fan of this back in the old interface. Was clear with pictures, straight forward. This new interface is boring, just another app, unengaging... Go back to old school!!",2
workout.progression.lite,Kallen Hager,It don't work right anymore :(,2
workout.progression.lite,Emre Aral,"I've been using this app for years and it's been so easy to create and manage routines, workouts and my progress. I enjoy looking at all the stats too. But I'm not a fan of some of the user experience changes in the latest major update. Before the update, during a workout, I could tap a set from a previous workout and any comments saved to the previous set would be pre-filled for the current set - now I can no longer single-tap copy a comment from a previous set and have to type it out every time. I use comments a lot and this change is time consuming in the middle of a workout. There is also no more Edit Comment button in the three dot menu next to a set (moved to the bottom of the screen, I prefer it in the previous location.) Also, sometimes I need to add a comment to a previous set in the CURRENT workout but now there is an additional Update button to tap after tapping OK to save the comment. Because this button is new, I forget to tap it sometimes, and I don't realise that a previous set is still highlighted with an unsaved comment, so I accidentally overwrite the set with the numbers for the next completed set. Please revert the commenting and editing experience to the previous iteration!",4
workout.progression.lite,Paul Durham,Can't edit workouts once saved! Can look back through workout history but cannot edit times or distances for any particular workout.,2
workout.progression.lite,Zach A,Was there a recent update? The font changed and the app has become laggier to input. The plate calculator is incorrect too. I've used this app for years with no complaints. Please let me know what changed. I will revise my app if this is fixed.,1
workout.progression.lite,Bosco Domingo,"This new update removed the ability to drag exercises around to reorder them and instead you have to chose ""Move up"" or ""Move down"". I mistakenly thought the author deleted my original 3-star review, and it was Google Play messing up. The app is certainly good (I even paid for the no-ads version), I hate not having that functionality and would like to see it come back and he seems like a nice person over emails. Sorry for the misunderstanding!",5
workout.progression.lite,Norman Hu,"Great app, been using it for years. Latest update solves most of the issues with the new version.",5
workout.progression.lite,Erick Orozco,"Amazing app. Absolutely love it. Already comes with a bunch of pre-loaded exercise and workouts, and has the option to add new exercises and routines that are missing.",5
workout.progression.lite,Gatlee Kaw,It's working again! Favourite workout tracking app for sure,5
workout.progression.lite,Anton Hoskam,This is the absolute best workout tracker for the gym.,5
workout.progression.lite,David,"Used to be a very good app, easy to use and perfect for tracking progress. Unfortunately the last update greatly decreased the performance on my phone, everything feels slow and sluggish and often the first numbers are not recognized when typing. Please try to increase performance again! :(",3
workout.progression.lite,Marc Labrecque,Great app,5
workout.progression.lite,Max Stober,where d0 i donate you rock also is there a git hub i can contribute to ?,5
workout.progression.lite,JP Addison,Very user-friendly features. Nice work.,5
workout.progression.lite,Trevor McCain,"Been using this tracker for a few years now and haven't found one I like better yet. Simple and easy to use, it's great for my purposes. Looking forward to new features with the next update.",5
workout.progression.lite,Stepan Kornyakov,"This used to be a great app, right until the major update. Unfortunately, the update really screwed up a lot of things. Here are the things that absolutely need to be added back asap: - full backup and restore (how are we supposed to change phones without losing all data?), - sync with Google Fit, - take weight and repetitions from the corresponding set in the previous session, not just from the previous set in the current session, - showing the rest timer even when it goes below 0:00. Thanks!",3
workout.progression.lite,Riley,Definelty not female friendly...,1
workout.progression.lite,Andrew Kovatch,"I've been using this app for years and it's perfect for what it does. Had some issues with the the latest update, importing data to lbs vs kg, but once I inreimported everything is good. Developer continues to add new features while maintaining the simplicity that makes this app great. Highly recommended.",5
workout.progression.lite,Laura Lee,"I love using this app and have done for years. It's so helpful being able to put together my own plans. The developer always replies quickly to any queries, thank you!",5
workout.progression.lite,Ξ Π,"This is an undated review given the new updates to the app. You've made it far worse, I can no longer export at all, when I go into the app to view my stats, I see some graphs ""volume, max weight, max 1rm etc"" but no ability to drill down into the movements themselves. I can't see my max deadlift, or how much bench press volume I've done, or how many sessions I had in Sept. How is this better? Are we waiting for more updates? I bought this app because of how much visibility it gave me into my long term lifting stats, it looks like you've been progressively removing that functionality. ""Export to csv as it stands is far too restricted. The csv export ought to be far more granular. I should be able to see what movement I did, when, and with what weight. All of that data is sitting in the app, so when I export it, I'd like to see it. I don't need my raw data to be curated. I'd like to be able to build my own graphs, create my own projections etc. Additionally, being able to see the frequency of my sessions, by week, month etc. Anyhow, great application, but giving users more access to their data would be nice.""",2
workout.progression.lite,JoaoMVR,Been using this for a long time and love it for its simplicity and versatility.,5
workout.progression.lite,Lisa,Was great but since update the rest timer doesn't continue after set rest time and there's no way to import data. Hate it now,2
workout.progression.lite,Adriano Ariganello,"I love the app. I use it with a bunch of custom workouts I switch between every few weeks. Even when it's missing particular exercises, it's very easy to add them. One feature I'd love to see is a quick way to review a set - easy, hard, etc. I'm using the comments to do that now so I know when to up the weight. It would be great if this was built in.",5
workout.progression.lite,Jeff L,"It's still very good, just wish we could connect to Google Fit like in previous versions.",4
workout.progression.lite,Matt Lavin,It's the minimum you need to track workouts,3
workout.progression.lite,Justin Snell,Phenomenally designed app with a rich feature set balanced perfectly with simplicity and ease of use. Glad the dev is back at it!,5
workout.progression.lite,John Smith,"Older version was simply superior in terms of functionality. New version looks pretty but lacks a persistent rest timer, lacks a rest timer that can continue timing into negatives and lacks easy to view stats of previous workouts all at once (all of which were in the older version). Why take out features?",3
workout.progression.lite,Eric S,"Was my favorite app, my phone auto updated when I was on wifi and version 2.0 is unbearable. Everything converted weird and the plate calculations can no longer adjust. I will be looking for a new work out app unfortunately.",1
workout.progression.lite,Braxton King,Can you bring back the previous statistical view? Making everything into one big graph makes it too hard to see individual data points. Also much harder to know what my personal best is for any particular exercise.,3
workout.progression.lite,Борис Шемраев,This app is unintuitive. I spent 20 minutes and still no idea how to use it and what to click. Not for me,2
workout.progression.lite,luntiang pentakulo,Design is simple and interface is very user-friendly. Exercises and programs are flexible and highly customizable. Being able to backup data to Google is also a plus. Can't wait for the upcoming updates (Google Fit and Import/Export)!,5
workout.progression.lite,Armando Ibarra,"Great way to create custom workouts. If you want to take your workouts to the next level by analyzing data, this is it. I wish it had tizen support though....",5
workout.progression.lite,John Gauthier,"After 5+ years, this is still the best lifting app on the market. Has all the functionality I need and is easy to use. The update was a surprise, but it's turning out to be a welcome one. At it's core the app still provides what I need, but now it has a fresh new design.",5
workout.progression.lite,James Wong,"Really hoping for features to come back after the update, it's hampering the experience. Also wish there was a way to import a spreadsheet, or a way to edit online without having to input them manually on my phone which can be time consuming. I've looked to Simple Workout Log for this feature as I can add my exercises a lot faster - would gladly pay a small fee to fund this as the rest of the features of Progression are superior.",4
workout.progression.lite,Lyle Schemmerling,Google Fit sync still not working after the update. Was there before. What gives?,2
workout.progression.lite,Anant Chowdhary,The statistics page has suddenly been rendered useless after the latest update. Is there a volume per exercise based graph anymore ? Thank you,5
workout.progression.lite,Guido Smeets,Hands down the most user friendly gym tracker in the market.,5
workout.progression.lite,Rishabh Sharma,Update made it completely rubbish,2
workout.progression.lite,Alastair Finlay,"Was a big big fan of this application before the upgrade. The new graphs aren't helpful to me at all. We've lost the automatic 1RM calculations, there's no pie chart at the end of workouts and the once ""easy to use and understand"" historical data now appears as a big lump of graph.",3
workout.progression.lite,Dion Chong,"Easy to use, visually pleasing. Perhaps I'm less fussed as a newer user than those who have been using this app for some time. However, it seems like I just missed the boat for Pro. I already dislike apps with a subscription model, and the cost of Premium is too high. Dev seems great, and were this the Action Launcher model I'd be more than happy to support. As it stands, I'm going back to FitNotes",2
workout.progression.lite,Josh Kellett,"Was my favourite app, period, until the recent updates. Overall much less pleasant to use, workouts don't seem to complete when I tell them to, all my historical data got updated to kilos, etc. Extra star is for nostalgia.",2
workout.progression.lite,Caroline Jones,"Edit: down to 4 stars. Still love the app, don't like the new update sooo side-loaded the old version .apk from APKPure. Happy again!",4
workout.progression.lite,B. M. S.,I'm changing my review from the previous. Developer reached out and I was able to import my previous workouts. Great app.,5
workout.progression.lite,Luis Linarez,"Over 5 years waiting. Paid for pro years ago. And for what? A UI change? To anyone reading this, it's useful but doesn't have half the features of what any other app has at this point. Don't ever spend a dime on this place. Like myself a lot of us did years ago, and it's been a nonstop roller coaster of reasons and excuses and explanations of why this never got meaningful updates. So enjoy it as a free product, nothing more.",1
workout.progression.lite,dd W,"Clean design, intuitive functionality, great developer support ... well worth the price of a cup of coffee for the upgrade. This workout tracker is by far the best of the many I have tried over the years. Very pleased.",5
workout.progression.lite,Michael Tavener,It says I can import my old data by hitting a button... But that button isn't visible and I can't scroll to it. Bummer.,3
workout.progression.lite,Steph,App is working great again. Thanks to the developer for working on this! By far my favourite app for tracking workouts and exercise history.,5
workout.progression.lite,Ronen Schwarz,"Have been using this app for years, Android 11 did cause it to break, but now it's working and better than ever with 2.0. Cannot recommend this app enough, have shown it to many people in person!",5
workout.progression.lite,Tim Paglione,"It seems to have lost some functionality - won't stop the screen from sleeping (have to set in settings before each use, it doesn't stick), doesn't make the sound after the timer stops, the timer button pens the time selector but won't start. All these are turned on in the settings.",3
workout.progression.lite,silverwhite11,"not easy to add, keep on loop round and round, when trying to add",2
workout.progression.lite,Rich Spoon,So glad this has been updated and is finally back! Best workout app there is by far!,5
workout.progression.lite,Rossp P,Had some issues with the app. Developer has reached out incredibly quickly to resolve any problems,5
workout.progression.lite,Ben,Please bring back the timer as it's one of the most important features. It's annoying to have to twitch between different apps but other than that I'm glad to see this app back,3
workout.progression.lite,aditya khot,Perfect workout and workout log companion. Keeps on improving.,5
workout.progression.lite,Tim Bremner,I dont get it. Totally overhauled the interface and every change seems to have been for the worse.,2
workout.progression.lite,Ojas Parashar,Edit 1: Mr. Demant seems like a stand up guy and I've shot him an email with all the features that the old app had that the new one doesn't + some ideas on where to take the app in the future. I'll keep updating the review as Mr. Demant updates the app! Original: The new update has added a fancy UI at the cost of app functionality. I cant see what my estimated 1RM max is anymore. - it just shows a graph and I can't pull the numbers. Seeing historical without days requires me to select a workout. Just seems like pointless changes. I'd really like an option to rollback.,2
workout.progression.lite,Wookiee81,"It's clean and simple. Such a relief with all the flashy colourful apps out there there try to overcomplicate a process that is essentially lift weight, wait. Does what you need. Highly recommend.",5
workout.progression.lite,Amado González Rodríguez,Nice redisign and I have all my previous data back,5
workout.progression.lite,Davide De Rosa,"Best tracking app hands down. Strong sucks in comparison, beyond being extremely buggy and overpriced. UPDATE: not happy at all about the update, will report bugs I found along the way.",2
workout.progression.lite,Andrew Passarello,thanks for updating to make it work on Android 11,5
workout.progression.lite,Alex Marshall,"Quite buggy after recent major update. Stats not being recorded correctly, supersets not working correctly, etc. Uninstalling for now. Previous version of app worked great.",2
workout.progression.lite,jacob g,"New statistics page is harder to read, I can't tell what my estimated 1 rep max is anymore because it's now a chart. I'd love for the current one to be included, but the old statistics page was more useful.",4
workout.progression.lite,Pramoth Rengan,Been using this app for 2 years . The new update is not logging my history anymore. It only shows my workout history before the update only.,4
workout.progression.lite,Bret Toews,"Love the new redesign so far, nicely done! My old workouts did import in KG even though I specified LB.",5
workout.progression.lite,Andrew Cam,"My review previously was an average review, but the developer responded quickly and changed this entire thing around. Evidently, my issue was my own fault, and he quickly resolved it. I'm excited to see where he takes this app further. Cheers, and this app is well worth it.",5
workout.progression.lite,Brandon H,"Not a big fan of this update as someone who has been using the app for many years. When I imported my information from the previous version, the import didn't exactly translate very well and I had to go back and edit the program to bring it back to it's original state. I found it somewhat tedious to rewrite my program, as the first two exercises of every workout were removed from the superset. I found the process for writing down the supersets to be much less intuitive than the older version.",2
workout.progression.lite,Leon Baker,"I've used this app for years and it's done about 90 percent of what I need very well. I guess it's going under a revamp... My workout routines are gone. I have to use my history to pull up a workout. I changed settings to lbs but my past sets are kg so I'm not sure where to start without a calculation. Google fit sync is gone... I'm just a sad panda. This morning's workout is super frustrating. I guess if your a new user, this app is gonna be awesome. It does look slick now.",2
workout.progression.lite,Dandy Park,"This is by far the best workout logging app I've ever tried. The update to 2.0 was a bit bumpy – I thought my 2+ years of data had vanished, but it was just a matter of finding the right import option in the settings. The developer was exceptionally responsive and helpful. The new update looks very exciting, and I'm really looking forward to the new features - thanks for creating such a great product, Zoltan!",5
workout.progression.lite,Ray,The only resistance training tracker app that I use. The Watch App should be back soon for it.,5
workout.progression.lite,Soufin Rahimeen,Newest update deleted all my saved workout plans and workout history.,1
workout.progression.lite,julian “Julian” calendar,"Great app, been using it for years. I'm no longer able to use the Google drive sync feature. Bought a new phone and don't have access to my old custom workouts. Going this feature gets fixed. Otherwise 5 start app.",3
workout.progression.lite,Dilwar Miah,Garbage app doesn't even save workouts,1
workout.progression.lite,Rebecca Wilson,Since having to change over to a new phone I can't get any of my data from my old phone. I'm signed into google drive but that doesn't seem to do anything. Also the app on my new phone won't let me even start a workout...,1
workout.progression.lite,Ian Hyzy,Tapping a new schedule and clicking add schedule just kicks me back to the home screen with the old schedule,3
workout.progression.lite,Jeric Ilagan,Horrible. Randomly lost 2 years worth of progress reports and saved workouts. App is now not letting make any changes to the workouts,1
workout.progression.lite,Rostyslav Roshak,Lost all the progress after update.,1
workout.progression.lite,Matthew Torres,Bought the App years ago because it was very customizable. The new update fixes all the drawbacks and kept all the positives. Have only used one fitness app because this is the best.,5
workout.progression.lite,Daniel G,Its not letting me create my own workout routine. Whats going on?,3
workout.progression.lite,Conor Kay,Doesn't save custom schedules anymore,1
workout.progression.lite,Brian K,"I've used the app for the past year. I've been very happy with it. It's currently going thru a revamp, so some features are in process, but it is an app I use several days a week. The developer is extremely responsive. Cannot recommend highly enough",5
workout.progression.lite,Michael,"I'm sad that the android 11 update seems to have broken this app. It was my go-to lifting app for the last couple years. I lost all my records and custom workouts. I had it set to auto backup to Google drive, and the file is still there, but the app can't seem to see it.",2
workout.progression.lite,John Veysey II,"Paid user, using this for 4 years 3-5 times a week. It's been great. Some glitches with the newest version, that supports Android 11. The author replied to my concerns promptly and plans to address. Fingers crossed, will update if it doesn't happen!",5
workout.progression.lite,Tomas Luhed Lindahl,"Updated to version 2. Features seem to be missing. I can no longer see statistics for certain exercises, just overall stuff like volume. Is that feature hiding somewhere?",2
workout.progression.lite,Michael Wilson,"I've been using this for years to record my workouts and can't fault it. Simple and effective, records what I've done each workout and is easy to check the previous week so I can continue to progress. So many apps out there with a monthly subscription and ads but this costs basically nothing. Love it.",5
workout.progression.lite,Kelsey Lennox,This used to be my favourite workout app but it deleted my progress and personalised routines a couple times. I paid for pro and it still won't save anything. On Android 11.,2
workout.progression.lite,Pawel Adamczyk,"It worked on my previous phone. Now when I press start workout something flashes and nothing happens. Your backup system is horrible, it's stuck on exporting. Syncing phone with Google drive doesn't really do anything.",1
workout.progression.lite,Joshua McFall,I've been using it for years no problems but i come back to it after covid without accees to any of my old stats or my paid features :'''(,5
workout.progression.lite,E P,"Used to be my go-to app. Paid for the pro version. Now, it keeps deleting my created workouts on my devices. Nothing will save. I think the most recent update bricked the app. But very frustrating all the same. I was halfway through creating a new workout and before I had time to go back and insert all the reps/sets, it already deleted it. There is a save option but I just didn't think it would self delete so quickly.",2
workout.progression.lite,Roy Holt,"If you want to do a common routine like SL5x5, this is fine. However, it doesn't save custom workout routines. I've tried to create my own routine three times now and no matter how many times I hit 'save' it disregards everything I did and my workout routine doesn't show up anywhere.",2
workout.progression.lite,Simon Giuliano,The app is great but it stopped working after latest Android update and I lost all my custom and previous workouts.,3
workout.progression.lite,Chris Linton,"Been using the Pro version of this app for a few years and loved the custom feature. Recently rebooted my phone and reinstalled the app and now find I am not able to customise my own workout, I create it but then it vanishes. Any help to fix this would be great as I don't want to use another app.",3
workout.progression.lite,Shane Moroshkin,"The app used to be fantastic. Recently downloaded it again to my Google Pixel, and it is unusable. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.",3
workout.progression.lite,otherone 747,Welp lost all my data including my custom made workouts. Even more infuriating is that for some reason I lost my upgrade too.,1
workout.progression.lite,Oskars Lielmanis,App doesnt work anymore,1
workout.progression.lite,Yanie Nicole,Dude this app is broken. I can't save my workouts and every time I close and reopen the app it wipes my progress and reinstates the 5x5 stronglift schedule. Your app is LITEREALLY called progression and it can't even keep track of progress. Refund please.,1
workout.progression.lite,Oscar Ramirez,I can't even start new workouts now. I used to love this app. Shame.,1
workout.progression.lite,I am Me,"Used this app for a while- paid version. Did the update for Android, the app stopped working. It has been weeks, and the app a) can't be used b) lost all workout data. I'd like my money back *note reply below claiming in a few days this would be fixed. I'd like my money back. Creator should stop lying Update: Still no change to the program, still doesn't work, still no refund.",1
workout.progression.lite,Garrett Dillon,"I had an issue where I could no longer access Pro features even though I bought them. The developer reached out to me and got this fixed, so kudos to him for good customer service. This is a pretty good app for serious lifters, but it could use some new features, like RPE or % intensity tracking, workout routine sharing between users, and more to remain competitive.",4
workout.progression.lite,Jack Armstrong,"App used to be exceptional, but now cannot create own workout schedule. Spend ages putting in and saving but then the whole thing disappears. Real shame as it was such a good app",1
workout.progression.lite,Fran Bartolić,The app doesn't work anymore. When I try to save a schedule I created it disappears.,1
workout.progression.lite,Leo,"Is there a way to enter the routines in circuit mode, i.e. a sequence of different exercises with a pause between circuits?",3
workout.progression.lite,Jonathan Starnes,App won't update workouts. App won't start workouts. App won't save changes. Fundamentally broken.,1
workout.progression.lite,Nevada Hemopo,"App wont let me select workout now, and wont let me create new workout schedules. First time ive ever had this problem.",3
workout.progression.lite,Andrew Brockmann,"App does not work on my Galaxy note 20 ultra. I try to make and use other workouts and it only lets me see one workout, which is uneditable too. I loved the app when it worked but sadly I've seen thats changed. Other recent reviews shoe the same.",2
workout.progression.lite,venkatesh pandian,Same experience as the other reviewers of the pro. Progressive app since Android 11. I lost my data from before and I also can't log workouts anymore. Emailed Zlatan for updates.,3
workout.progression.lite,Drew Denson,"I have it loaded on my phone (Google Pixel 5). Can't import/restore data from my backup on Google Drive. When I try to start a workout (""Do Now"") it doesn't start (stays on same menu/page).",2
workout.progression.lite,Jay,"I'm delighted this app is now available for Android 11! Until now, I've been having to use it on my old phone, because I love this app so much. It's quite flexible and allows me to easily track and access my workouts for years now. Thank you!!!",5
workout.progression.lite,Kyle HansenKahn,"It was a fantastic app, EXCEPT now it totally doesn't work on galaxy s21",2
workout.progression.lite,Dustin Ernberger,"I've used a number of strength training apps over the years, and this is definitely my favorite. I was even willing to pay for the premium version, which is saying something. It has a large database of exercises, and you can create your own. I really like the way it allows you to build supersets and circuits into the routine. It's very easy to look back at past workouts, so you know exactly what you need to accomplish when you're in the gym.",5

workout.progression.lite,M K,A phone OS update wiped my data from the app. I tried to restore a backup but it couldn't find any backups to restore. Uninstalling and going with another workout app.,1

workout.progression.lite,Joshua Yun,No longer works with the latest version of Android. Was a great app previously. Unfortunately it's unusable now.,1

workout.progression.lite,Rob M,"I originally gave the app 5 stars, then edited it to the 1 star, after it stopped working. Then after doing some digging have found it was the latest Android update that is incompatible with the app and the developer is working on fixing that. So my rating is incomplete . Once it is back up and running again, I'd recommend it to everyone.",1

workout.progression.lite,Alexander Khamdamov,"I'm sorry but its ridiculous that data backups don't work, like many others I lost years of data and custom work outs. I have a lifetime subscription but I will be switching, developer seems to have abandoned the app. Incredibly disappointing!",1
workout.progression.lite,Mario Cajas,Now it won't save anything. Please fix soon,1
workout.progression.lite,Matthew Evans,"I've been using this app for 4 years now and I though I had backed up my data.

workout.progression.lite,Daniel Crooks,"All personalised data lost after the last Android update i.e. dozens of customised exercises with instructions, workout history, personalised schedules. I will have to start from scratch if I were to continue using this app after almost 5 years. Made backup 2 months ago but the file is now not supported. The App does not sync with Google Drive or GoofleFit despite being permanently Logged in. Hence unable to retrieve data as it was never uploaded despite message indicating 'sync jusg now'",1

workout.progression.lite,Jesus Sanchez,"I've been using this app ever since I started working and is nice to go back and check how I started, I started almost 4 years ago.

I can't get them back update it and I will change to 5 stars",1
workout.progression.lite,DJ Johnson,"Edit 11/12/16: update will not save my workout schedules. Please fix, i love this app! Best app for tracking lifting sessions. I've tried probably 99% of them.

workout.progression.lite,Lee Marburg,Unfortunately no longer works with the latest Android version. Seems developer has abandoned the app.,1
workout.progression.lite,L M,It wouldn't save any of my created exercises or my own program. I tried 5 times.,1
workout.progression.lite,carzell harris,I cannot connect to my goggle drive and history keeps getting erased,4
workout.progression.lite,Vivek Pradeep,Like most apps.. lacks lot of features. To name the most important and the bear minimum the app should have is lack of certain exercise names. In short do not waste time of you are into calisthenics or resistance band training.,1
workout.progression.lite,K Johnson,App doesn't work after Android update. Cannot start workouts or use any workout schedules. 5 stars otherwise.,1
workout.progression.lite,Olivier Hens,"Great app! Been using it for quite some time now. Upgraded to the paid version, long due. The developer responds to almost every message on Reddit. So people giving bad ratings are running Android 11 and didn't read any of those. This is the only fitness app you will ever need. Kudos Zoltan! Keep up the good work and stay safe! Lycka till!",5
workout.progression.lite,Hccdgvv Fccdgn,I'm waiting for the 2.0 which is being developed.,4
workout.progression.lite,Tim Large,"It's a really good app for tracking workouts been using it for about a year. Really nice to build your own routines and see the stats for it. However the only annoying thing is that sometimes it doesn't sync properly to Google fit, so either it doesn't sync at all (really need a force sync button) or it will say it's synced and the stuff won't appear in Google fit at all. I have other tracking apps which work of the data in Google fit so it's super important that the information goes in there",3
workout.progression.lite,Derek Jensen,Worked great now it doesn't work at all so annoying,1

workout.progression.lite,Jian Yang,"Loved it for years when it worked since the alternatives aren't nearly as good (apart from dark mode), but now I can't even install it on android 11 and promises of fixes are months old.

workout.progression.lite,Zack Szamosvari,"Can you PLEASE FIX THIS APP? For the third time I've gone back and manually re-input all my workout schedules, hoping that some update had fixed the issue that deleted them all. I even paid for the app upgrade.

Please, this was a really fantastic app once upon a time, but I cannot recommend it to friends interested in fitness anymore since it's absolutely broken and all of my data is gone. PLEASE.",2
workout.progression.lite,Jade Jones,Great app 👍. Able to log my workouts real time with smartwatch app. Super convenient. Can't figure out how to program supersets in my scheduled workouts though. Maybe a tutorial page will help.,5
workout.progression.lite,Jason Curtis,"Update. Like lots of others this app broke with Android 11. Thankfully the tablet I use while working out doesn't support 11 and thus it's still usable. Looks like the dev is working on an update, so anxiously awaiting that. Progression does everything I need in a work out app. Couldn't be happier to have this on my phone tracking my lifting.",5

workout.progression.lite,John Lloyd,"Amazing App, have used it since 2016!... Its tracked 1000's of workouts, largely ones i've made myself, i've created 100's of exercises on there aswell. Well today i logged in to do my workout (like i always do), loaded up the history to compare to what i had planned today to last time and nothing on there... Its lost everything... All my work for the last 4 years gone, all workouts gone, all the progression gone! Gutted is an understatement... Im heart broken! :( Please please please fix!",3
workout.progression.lite,Ramón Costa,"Used the premium version since 2016 and lost all my data due some google drive something, very frustrating, but dev are looking forward to get this fixed. Hopefully soon, I'm lazy to learn how to use other app.",2

workout.progression.lite,Harold MacDonald,I lived this app. But the new Android upgrade makes the app unusable. I lost all of my schedules and I can let change schedules from the default 3 day full body. When fixed I will give a 5 star. Note it says no Google Play services are available,1

workout.progression.lite,Sean Hill,"I am having the same issue as Andrew.

So, if this is fixed I will gladly change my review to 5 stars.",1
workout.progression.lite,Ed,"Perfect until latest Android update. As other users have mentioned, the latest update has wiped all of my progress since I started using the app, and will not let me record new sessions. Needs a fix or it is unusable!",3
workout.progression.lite,Benjamin Mandl,Years of workout data is gone since updating to Android 11. Sucks.,1

workout.progression.lite,Luke Robbertse,Great app. Really happy. However it has recently stopped connecting to my Google account and I have lost all history. There is no way for me to contact the Devs other than this. Not happy with drop in service and no way to reach out for resolution.,5
workout.progression.lite,Brian Mcclintock,"9/23 UPDATE: I continued using this app because I decided I didn't need the Google fit integration but now I realize this was a mistake. I updated to Android 11 and all my workout History, custom exercises, and weight history were wiped. 2 years of workout data I relied daily on all gone because I simply updated my phone. Stay away from this app if you plan to use it to track your progress and workouts consistently. It is still good for casual use though.",1
workout.progression.lite,Andrew Morris,It was the best app on the market but since new Android update it is absolutely unusable. I have used this app for close to a year to track workouts and build routines but today I logged on to find EVERYTHING DELETED. I no longer have my numbers from previous workouts and have lost all progression. I cannot even launch it to track a prebuilt workout. It will launch and then immediately close. There needs to be a solution soon or this great app will have to be replaced by another one,3
workout.progression.lite,Wei Wang,"It is broken in Android 11, and I told the developer nback to March when running beta. They never did any fix and reply to my email.",1
workout.progression.lite,Farrukh Qazi,"So something went wrong, I had tons of workouts done on this app and backed up on Google drive. Today I opened the app and everything is gone. Any help? I need those custom workouts that I created and I had a long history of my workouts that I do not want to loose.",4

workout.progression.lite,Benjamin Kirik,"Randomly deleted all of my progress and deleted all of my excercise despite being connected to Google drive and whenever I try to press the work out button, everything flashes and it goes back to the same screen. Unusable now, used to really work pretty well.",1
workout.progression.lite,Charles Watson,Best app for lifting until recent changes caused all data to be wiped and can no longer track or add new workouts. Update: still no update however developer is maintaining constant contact with users to fix the issue.,4
workout.progression.lite,Stewart Lee,Best app out there to track gym lifting sessions. Developer is very responsive and is working on fixing the issues from the Android 11 update. There's isn't much as far as updates to the app as it's pretty dang complete as is!,5
workout.progression.lite,Carlos Pereira,"I love this app but it just stopped working in Android 11. My old schedules disappeared and if I select a new schedule, it just don't accept it. Sorry for downgrading the stars.",3
workout.progression.lite,Dominic Love,"This was a great app, but all of a sudden it's stopped working. I've lost all my data and plans. The app is also not updated regularly, and it seems it has been left in beta for years. It's a shame, because it honestly is a great app.",2
workout.progression.lite,David Gonzales,Had been using for years and swore by it. Randomly nuked all my custom workouts and years worth of data today. Might be time to find a new app.,1
workout.progression.lite,Kahlo Hendrix,"I love this app but I recently updated to Android 11 and now I lost all my data and I can't even add my workout schedules anymore, hopefully an update comes out soon because this is legit the best app I've used to track my workouts.",5
workout.progression.lite,Nathan Schwermann,Also had years of history erased and custom workouts deleted.,1
workout.progression.lite,DJK,"Best gym tracker for advanced lifters, just needs an update/refresh. Interface is clean, simple, intuitive. Thoughtful UX features other trackers lack: plate calculator, notes for each specific set, etc. Main issue is no recent update. I'd love to see ability to delete built-in exercises (#1 complaint), dark mode, custom plates, weight % calculator (i.e. to find 70% of a previous set's weight), manual sync/backup, and a pro version to support the developer with donations or one-time purchase.",4
workout.progression.lite,Manolis “The Mayor” Rhodokanakis,All data lost for no apparent reason.,1
workout.progression.lite,Octavian Voicu,"Not actively maintained (last update in 2018). Recently all my history, custom schedules and workouts were deleted. I was able to recover history by disconnecting Drive sync and re-enabling, but the others are still gone. I can't even add a custom schedule now.",2
workout.progression.lite,Cathal Conroy,"Excellent app, been using it for 2 years.",5
workout.progression.lite,Joe Young,App deletes my custom made workouts. Started happening out of nowhere.,2
workout.progression.lite,Richard Waeteraere,Burpees not available in the app. Burpees are a very popular exercise. Weird that there are 20 different squat variations but burpees are not possible.,1
workout.progression.lite,Gregory Baran,Comprehensive list of excercises. Would be 5 stars with the ability to add your own excercises on the pro version.,4
workout.progression.lite,Johann Botha,"Bought the app because I liked the no-fuss approach. Since then, my complete workouts and history have been deleted twice in the last 3 weeks. I was also under the impression that I was syncing to Google Drive, but I can't find anything in my drive that even remotely appears to be Progression data",1
workout.progression.lite,Thiago Camargo,"Best app out there, I love it",5
workout.progression.lite,Pedro Teixeira,Really good. Love the simple interface and included plans and famous plans. Wondering if the calory counting is actually taking into account the weights etc. But really good so far.,4
workout.progression.lite,Micah Larson,Rest timer doesn't display and gogle drive syncing doesn't update,2
workout.progression.lite,Beef Cake,Used it for years now. Customized many WO. Awesome app.,5
workout.progression.lite,Marc Lehman,Perfect! I've been using it consistently for 5 years now! It was and continues to be a life changer. It helped me form a consistent workout schedule that I actually stick to. I couldn't be happier with an app.,5
workout.progression.lite,DIVINE AMAR,Potential good app.. Integrate with Google fit app is good.. But boring interface.. And worst is no voice during workout.. Only vibration.. Will be good if integrates with google voice too,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This app is awesome but I hope they add some things in the future. If there was the option to add muscle groups to be more specific and the option to delete the existing exercises it would be the best fitness app. But until then I will just stick with my excel sheet.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love it!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Work schedules randomly disappeared and now I've lost all my history. I love this app, but I suspect that there's a sudden issue with GDrive sync and as far as I can tell this app isn't being maintained anymore, sadly.",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,great functionality with elegant UI. will dark mode be available soon?,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The most complete training app I've ever come across. Couldn't recommend more highly,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Thanks Zoltan for pointing to the reddit thread where I can see the app is still being worked on, just that it's not yet ready to be release in the Play Store. Rating bumped back up to 5 stars.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've been a fitness buff for decades. Just used this app for the first time. It has room for improvement of course, but it's incredibly amazing in many other way. Needs more bodyweight cardio exercises. Love how it has a shortcut that takes me right to my music player. Immediately syncs to Google Fit after your workout. Totally customizable workouts and fitness schedules. This is definitely a tinkerers delight.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Sync is not working, I cannot get my old workouts back after connecting to Google drive.",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I have been using this app for 3 years and I couldn't be happier. It's so simple to use and allows customization. I love it!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really great app for tracking workouts I've been using it for a good few years now. The only tiny niggle I have is that for cardio exercises like cycling and rowing seconds are not recorded which is frustrating when you are trying to improve your time. Also multiple sessions of say rowing are not allowed in one workout. Tiny niggles though,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Hands down the best fitness app around. No really. Some UI patterns were a bit confusing to learn, but after actually using it, you'll realise how powerful it is. It's feature complete, really. Wish it'll never go away. But I made a backup of the app just to be sure.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The images are not downloading doe the workouts. I just paid for Pro as an incentive to fix it :),3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app. Been using the app for 3/4 year now and have had absolutely no issues 👌,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Im really enjoying the app and have made great progress since using it. The only addition I would really like to see is a way to go to the next set from the lock screen. Unlocking my phone so frequently is inconvenient. Besides that small inconvenience the app is every you would want.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app and simple to use. Very responsive developer. Progression Body & weight log is by him as well and is worth it. Everything syncs well together and it has Google fit and Google drive sync.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I couldn't figure out how to modify weight in the sets.,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Despite being outdated and apparently dead (last release 2017), this is a great app, works wonders, easy to use, super configurable and best of all it syncs with google fit perfectly unlike other apps that are a hit and miss.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The images just stopped downloading on Samsung Galaxy S9. I tried reinstalling, clearing cache, etc. The images don't download no matter what.",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Been using this app for many years and it is unbeatable the best one for gym workouts tracking.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Updating my review: tried to look for your wear OS app on my smart watch. Couldn't find it. What happened?,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Good app, convenient and flexible. Has most exercises I use and you can add excersices pretty easily. It is not getting 5 stars only because I can't choose the default schedule and it don't open the last training I used.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Been using it for nearly two years, best app to help me track my progress and beat it each time 10/10",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. Would be fantastic if I could create a workout and then share to my friends.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. Simple effective and have been using it for years. Will never look elsewhere,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The best: perfect app: perfect support: and upcoming features are insane. Very good support forum with developers that listen to it's customers. Way better than , strong / fitnotes / jefit / etc etc...",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Tried 3 other apps before sticking with this one for close to 3 years now. Great tracker, excellent syncing between devices and phenomenal help from developer when needed!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've only used the app once, but so far I'm liking it a lot! I use a Google wear watch, so having it compatible with that is amazing. There are a few things though that I really wish this app did. The main thing is I wish that the app would allow me to share my workout schedule with a friend so they can use the same schedule, not just export your workout data. Another small thing would be to take in account your heartrate and bodyweight for calories burned. Overall pretty decent",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Mostly works smoothly and looks good. Would prefer if the rest timer was in app instead of a notification. Real issue, it absolutely will not let you skip a set/workout. Something tweaked in my hip on my 2nd squat set but it won't let me enter 0 reps for the third scheduled squatting set, and won't let me move on to the next workout on the plan. Really defeats the entire purpose of a workout tracker if you can't track what happens or have to fabricate sets. Hope that gets fixed.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Overall a very good app. It's easy to navigate and use, has a good interface, and supports backups on drive, which is convenient. I haven't encountered any issues/bugs in >1 year of using it. Since you can setup your own workout schedule, it's useable with most programs. One small downside is that there's no support for percentage-based weight progression, so if you're doing 5/3/1 or something similar you'd have to calculate the weights somewhere else.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Impossible to download exercise images,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Simple interface, no fluff, minimal interaction needed throughout your workout, really well done.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Hello. I have upgraded and the amount has also been deducted from the account. But still it's telling me to upgrade. Guide me.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Awesome app, been using for several years now. Only thing I would like to see added is the ability to assign a specific sound for the set timer. Otherwise awesome",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Very good app, simple and effective",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, simple and clutter free. But hasn't been updated in a long time and it shows. For example, the drop-down in the comment pop-up goes all the way down to the (gesture) nav bar, and it's difficult to select the last item called 'warmup'.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,My friend recommended this app to me about 3 years ago and I've been using it since. I have tried to use other apps in the past but they're just complicated and confusing. I recently switched over to an iPhone and it isn't available in the App Store. Are there any plans on releasing the app for the iPhone users in the future? I carry two phones to the gym just so that I can track my workouts using this app. It would be awesome if there was an iOS version of it.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I like the app a lot but recently exercise images no longer show up in the app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best app I've used for working out, just missing the option to share my workout schedule with friends, so they don't have to manually copy the workout.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This app was awesome until a recent Android update which causes frequent crashing and renders the app almost non-functional. Hopefully Zoltan can pinpoint the issue and update.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"And one more star for the app being able to work with my smartwatch, again! One more star for the developer answering to me ;-)... Semplicemente la migliore app perché con un solo acquisto hai le schede dei workout, ognuna con le giornate di allenamento. Ogni giornata ha vari esercizi. Poi c'è lo storico, e le statistiche, con l'indice 1RM, che dà un'idea di massima dello sforzo.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Amazing app, have been using for two years now and the simple interface and features like the rest timer and live workout tracking are hard to beat. To the author, should they ever read this, if we could get Tasker integrations (begin workout, complete set, next set...) this app would be perfect.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The best gym workout app I've tried... and I've tried quite a few. My search is over. 💪,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,App is great but Wear OS compatibility is severely lacking. Unable to scroll by using the crown and also notifications on watch does not take you back to the app.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Good app design but without updates or exercise photos :((,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Good one. Big list of exercise, links to YouTube. Lack of pictures, but it's minor.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love this app! Nice sleek interface, easy to use, includes a lot of information without being complicated.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I can't save any workouts even though I went though and ""completed workout"" via wear os device. Why? I also have no history and cannot log in via any gogglebaervoved. Uninstalled",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It would be better IF we can see the results. I can see numbers but cant see progression (tension or volume) In the other hand user cant make super set (group) Btw i like it,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really good app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app. Really easy to track what I've done once I've made a schedule though the creation of a schedule isn't always that intuitive initially. An idea to make this schedule creation easier is if the list of exercises menu only cover half the screen s you can see what you've got on your list more easily. Will this app get WearOS support at some point? That would be a killer feature.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I was looking for a way to track my weight training and get credit in Google Fit in order to earn points in my company's wellness plan. The first day seemed to work and show the correct data in Google Fit, but partway through my day, my data in Google Fit was partially lost. It shows that I trained in the morning, but my move minutes, heart points, calorie burn and heart rate data is gone. disconnected Progression from Google Fit and reconnecting it did nothing to solve the problem. Update: Not long after writing this review and uninstalling the app, Google Fit seems to be giving me credit for the workout all of a sudden. I'm not sure what's going on. Feeback: I often map out my lifts before setting foot in the gym, so I know what each and every set's weight and rep goal is ahead of time. I'd like to do that in this app, so I can just open it up and it tells me what to load onto the bar.",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is my jam.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"In general one of the best on the market. But, what's missing is possibility to view all history in calendar view. That's a big minus. I paid for the full version and I'm a user for more than a year now, and I would really appreciate if you could do that update and possibility to scroll through the years and days and look all the passed workouts in that view it would be 5+. ;)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The app is fine but not great. I have the pro version but what they really need to do is look at other work out apps and figure out how to utilize the best features from them while doing a severe overhaul of their UI. The UI is not user friendly or intuitive.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Samsung health Integration would be 5/5,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great and super usefull to keep you on track. great support, thanks!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Useful & Reliable. Progression Workout Tracker is a simple workout tracking app that is easy to use and offers everything I need. I like that it works well on/off line and automatically backs up my data. The Wear OS intergration needs a little refinement, but is definitely useable. Overall a great app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app! The pro version is worth it. Clean interface and easier to use than other apps. Added functionality to integrate with HR and Calories from trackers like Fitbit, etc would be really helpful and make the app a complete package. And a few more added exercises (variations of existing ones) would be awesome. A progression tracker definately helps build confidence and also plan accordingly. Great job!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Edit: Exported CSV file does not actually include exercise data. More let downs: 1. Day ends at midnight rather than say 4am, so history is messed up for people who exercise late at night. 2. Notes are not linked to the exercise, so have to add notes again each time add exercise to something. 3. Editing name or type (weight/time based) for a custom exercise does not update it in schedule. 4. Connecting with google drive broken. 5. No images for exercises and setting to download them is broken.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Mediocre,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This has been a really useful tool but it would be nice to track bodyweight with completed workouts. Even better if calories burned correlated to that weight.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The app is really good. I like the interface. It feels clean and well organized. I purchased the pro version and the statistics and analysis are really helpful. It only misses a calendar option (you have the workout history, but it is not the same). very good job developer. If it ever gets the calendar, I will update my review to 5 stars.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Started using it today. Was impressed with the functionality. Visually good. My only beef is that i should be able to mark warm up sets separately from my working sets. Update - 3 years still my favourite app, except when I run wendlers. I don't think there is anything else better than this",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I really liked the app and decided to pay for it a year back, but now I'm fed up with it. It has twice lost my whole history due to some bug, first after 77 workouts, and now after 61 workouts. A small part of the data remains but most is lost. After the first time I decided to simply start my log again from scratch hoping it was some weird fluke. Now that it happened to me again - well, I just need to throw it away.  EDIT: The problem is with my Xiaomi phone. Only fair that I change the rating accordingly, because outside of the issues I'm having this is the only workout tracker that I like.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"i like the app. I wish it had time settings. For treadmill, elliptical, stairs, or just planks.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've been using this app for about 6 weeks and thought I'd give some feedback.  The app is awesome in it's simplicity ... no fancy graphics, no instructional videos... just a great Material Design... very intuitive.  Tracks progress of both your workouts in terms of weight or time, and their is a companion app to track your Body stats.  Add your own exercises complete with weight or time based, the body part your exercising, and equipment.  You can add exercises to groups (Supersets), add rest periods between exercises, and haven't found the upper limit on sets or reps.  I'd give it 5 stars but there is one major flaw that I really don't understand.  The whole app is structured around a schedule.  So you create a workout schedule, and you give each day of the schedule a name, and assign exercises to the schedule for that day.  Huh?  It is the most back assward way of doing things I've ever seen.  There is no need for a ""schedule"" at all.  The app tracks your workouts and tells you exactly when you did them and gives you stats on them.  Just give me my exercises and the ability to create workouts.  I'll choose the workout I want to do on the day I want to do it thanks.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app and looking forward to the next update. It would be great to have more stat's and ways of measuring improvement or previous Workouts. This might be a stretch but an online dashboard and way of adding Workouts would be incredible. Look forward to continuing to support your great work!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,progression.. that won't show your pregression unless you pay,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best app, simple and easy to use! I don't pay often for apps here, but this one is worth it",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is easily one of the best apps I've ever used.  It's the perfect blend of flexibility and automation.  I can find workouts I enjoy and very easily customize them to my liking.  Mad props to the developer.  I'm going to be sad if/when development ends on this app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Update: Still works great. Would it be possible to sync to Garmin watches (Garmin Connect)? I've tried many workout apps for the gym and I have been really happy with this one. Finally found the one app that does everything I need in the gym. And, its very easy to use with great features. Also Dev is great. Emailed him about an issue with changing a device. He returned my email promptly even though he was on vacation! So, good I paid for the Pro version twice. Update: Google Drive!!! Awesome!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is the best fitness tracker I have ever used! Highly recommend it.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best workout tracking app I've used. Theres a few quirks that you get used to real quick, and once you have it down pat its a wonderful workout tracker.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,why does it need access to my photos and personal contacts??,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have been using this app for over 3 years, I love the simplicity but also the amount of information you can feed into it if wanted. it is easy to program workouts and also change them on the fly, also your complete history of an exercise is shown when you are performing an exercise which is invaluable. I can't recommend this app enough, best fitness tracker!!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,havent used it yet,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"loving it so far, I like that it has many popular programs present, built my own in about a minute",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Good basic functionality. Here are a suggestions 1) Add precentage 1rm and RPE targets for program design. 2) Add RPE to set annotation. 3) Add an option to use RPE to calculate maxes. 4) Allow user created custom categories for muscle groups and movement patterns. 5) Add analysis for weekly volume and sets by category.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I bought the full version because I like how clean and intuitive the interface is. But it's twice completely reset and forgotten all my workouts and history. Incredibly frustrating.,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Ive been a faithful user for over 2 years. I love the history tracking to compare my progress.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,hard to use. how can i change kg to pounds? it is so hard trying to be converting everything. we are un usa everything is listed in stupid pounds.,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really simple app, and by that i mean straight forward. No gimmicks or fancy graphics, just straight up workout tracking. No subscription either which is a huge bonus. it's impossible to find fitness apps now that don't have some sort of sub model. There's a good range of individual workouts in the database and a few predefined routines to work from. Tracking is simple and settng up your own custom routines is dead easy. Haven't had any performance issues either.",5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,option to automatically backup to google drive is great.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Good app but it's been years since the last update, what happened to the developer? How about a new feature where exercises that are added midway during a workout will get saved so that next time i dont have to add it in again? [update] Improved rating to 4 stars due to dev's quick response, looking forward to new update, will give 5 stars when that happens",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is the most straightforward workout tracker I've used for Android. The only thing I wish it had is the ability to use a desktop program or app to create workouts and sync those with the mobile app. It can be a little tedious adding a long term program that varies from week to week (percentages, variable reps and sets, etc.), but that's the only thing I can think of that would make this thing absolutely perfect for me.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I wish it was possible to get the pro upgrade for the weight tracker and workout tracker together at a discount. Aside from this, its a fantastic and fluid app. Extremely user friendly.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"great app. I was wondering if u can add a feature where it would clearly show something like your best 1rm, 2rm ,3rm, 4rm etc etc. for each exercise",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Fantastic value for the price compared to other subscription based apps (JEFIT, BodyBuilding, etc). The simplicity and intuitiveness of the app are spot on. A few feature requests: - Picture/gif functionality for custom exercises - Tempo timer (2 second lift, 0 second rest at top, 1 second lower, etc) - Expand Exercise Library (both number of exercises and information per exercise)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app. Really helps me organize my workouts. I'm spending less time in the gym, but I leave feeling like I got a better workout than before. Highly reccomend.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really great UI and simple to use. I had been looking for an app like this for so long. The preset programs are interesting to look at as well. It helps me get pumped when I'm in the gym and keep a good track of my progress. It has been a real lifebloom and kept me in wild shape.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Quick and versatile app for gym training.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"love the app. So easy and customizable. To the developer, could you add a way to use percentages of a weight for sets? I'd like to build NSuns within the app as it's the most user-friendly I've come across but there is no way to do this currently, without breaking out a calculator",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Absolutely love this app I think is the best app for training in the app store Im using now for 2 or 3 weeks The only think that is missing is Taps as muscle group ore is in the back group,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,i would love to have the ability to switch between kg and lbs. Oftentimes i use olympic barbell and bumpers (kg) but switch to dumbbells (lbs) in the same workout. so far this app is pretty good and I'm considering upgrading to the pro version.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app, and it has been a major reason for me staying with my schedule. However, sometimes after completing a set, the rest timer won't start automatically, and I'll be left wondering when my next set will start, until I look at my phone again. It rarely happens, and with no recognisable pattern, so I guess it's hard to debug, and it's just a minor issue. Also, the exercise images aren't being downloaded, and the privacy policy page is broken. Thank you so much for this app!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"An excellent, intuitive and easy to use workout tracker that's perfect for setting up custom training programs and supports things like supersets in a good way. Also provides some nice stats and historic performance. We'll worth the price!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Simply the best app I've ever used to track workouts and progression. Thank you!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The only fitness application I've used for years and years on end.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app! Functionality & UX ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, similar to StrongLifts 5x5 by StrongLifts, but it allows you to create custom sequential workouts, add supersets to sequential workouts, create custom exercises (allowing you to do an exercise for time or for reps) and gives you statistics.  I often find myself adding instructions in a workout's description such as ""add 2 reps to final set, if all reps completed, increase weight next time. if 1 addt'l rep completed, maintain weight."" which seems like a clumsy way of doing things that i haven't always remembered to check next time i do that workout, it would nice to have a way to automate something like that, even if it was just ""choose next starting set weight"" as an option at the end of a set NOTE: This review originally was reduced two stars for the app unexpectedly not saving and tracking workouts. the developer and I found a workaround and he will be looking into the cause, great of the dev to get in touch with his users.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,best app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Thank you for not making a subscription based workout app. Great so far.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Seems like a great app but can't even type in weight for exercises on galaxy note 8,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is the best workout tracker I've found for weights-based activity.  The fact that the focus is on your own workout (rather than trying to foist routines and videos on you) and the ability to add your own exercises is great.  The tied-in body measurement app is also simple and flexible.  My only small request would be the ability to add bluetooth trackers like heart-rate monitors to track your workout as well - I use Google Fit and have to have this app as well as something like Strava running during my workout to get a complete picture.  If Progression could put that tracker data straight into google fit it would be all I'd ever need!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"great strength training app, allows for tracking caloric burn via strength traing as well as cardio and other excersizes",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"There are slight tweaks needed but otherwise a solid app. 1. let me create new comments that pre select on the next time I perform the exercise, for example using bands (with a bench press) 2. try to allow sync with myfitness pal so that the calories burned can be included. I love creating my own workout programs though.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Nice app I have been using their app for while .I hope I get more update s for the workouts,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a fantastic app that I've been using for years. Just two things that are missing: 1) it's own notification sound (it doesn't let you change the sound and uses your phone's default, which is confusing) and 2) a dark themed UI maybe",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"By far the best workout app I've ever used. Simple, well designed, super easy to start with a variety of default workouts if you're a beginner or to make your own if you know what you're doing.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great and simple app for constructing and adhering to a workout plan. Really hope work continues here to make features more robust.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,My absolute favorite fitness app. Intuitive and informative!,5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app. workouts are easy to access and well displayed. But I have a few suggestions for future features. 1) Let us add new exercise types, especially for combination exercises 2) Sync with bodytrax which is a popular tracking software for fat percentage etc used by gyms",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I love this fitness tracker. It let's me set a variety clear workouts and manages my time while I'm doing them. I hope the developer will continue work on this.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Easy to make your own workout routine or use the premade workout plans.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It has a rest timer; it tells you how much weight to put on each side of the bar; and workouts are quick and easy to set up - supersets, custom rest periods for each exercise, etc. Amazing!",5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It used to be great but lately it stops logging workouts halfway into them. 😭,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The app hasn't been updated in a year and a half. Suddenly my lifts are not logging despite submitting. Completely disrupted my workout. Time to find a new app,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is a great app with tons of features and it's easy to use.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really nice app for workout logging. The only thing it is lacking is 1 Rep Max calculator. Still the best I have tried though.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. Used it for 18month at least. Do have an odd request for the devs though. Can we get more/more varied colours on the muscle groupings? Other than that the app is topnotch.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I use it every time I go to the gym. Works great, haven't ever experienced any bugs, and while it hasn't been updated in a while, the developer seems busy behind the scenes. Worth paying for.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really great app. By far the most features and best functionality of anything in its typr, but it does one thing I really hate. The timer automatically opens the app when it's finished, which is functionality I would love to turn off. The timer is useful, but the number of times I've accidentally entered something into the app when I didn't want to because the window popped up without warning while I was typing on messenger or similar is unreal.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Bought the pro version, it is a really solid app - especially coupled with the Progression Body & Weight Log. My only gripe - which is kinda putting me off using it anymore (and which is the same for 9/10 of the competing apps) is the inability to create an entire program for many days with preset weights ie. that I can at once set the weights for all of my future workouts for weeks ie. extremely useful for something like HST where the weights are varying but planned ahead.",4

I'm 46 years male that started to lift when I was 19, but the last 8 years I've been in decline to the point I lifted once a month with zero motivation.   Thanks to this app I'm lifting 6 days a week from 30 to 90 minutes sessions! I can mix traditional weights with kettlebells. The timer feature is great, no more 10 minutes breaks between sets.  I also use Cronometer app to track my keto diet and Progression is able to upload the calories burned thru Google fit.   So far I lost 12 lbs and dropped to 14.8% body fat. 4% more to go.

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Nice APP, Could be better tho. I miss some graphics for the workouts and would be also nice to have a thumbnail image of the exercise you are going to do instead of just a big letter. Also more options to personalize the APP would be amazing , like options to change the theme to dark or just the notification sound  after your rest time ends.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The best workout App out there. And trust me, I've tried then all! Easy to 
set up custom workouts, auto rest timer (customisable rest time) which pops 
up as a small window so it's easy to get back to your workout, integrations

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I honestly love this app. I've purchased the pro unlock and everything has 
been great. The only issue I have with it is that, even though I have it

BUT:  When I track my training using the google fit app on my watch, it automagically detects what workout im doing and how many reps, and then when it saves that information in google fit it saves NOT JUST the calories burned, duration and heartrate, it ALSO saves each workout name the amount of weight lifted and the reps completed in the google fit app.  If you can get this app to send/save exercise name reps completed and weight used in the google fit app I will buy the pro edition and I will transfer ALL of my clients onto this app. It should be a pretty simple update -- I am a developer myself and very familiar with the google fit API.  Thanks Zoltan,  Feel free to email me if you have any questions.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Fantastic thank you,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Seems like a great app, but you cannot create days/programs with 
pre-programmed (or percentage of max) weights and reps which makes it not

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"In my opinion this is the best app to track workouts. No ads in the free 
version and one time charge for the pro version instead of a subscription

plus is the easy synchronization via Google drive because I use my old 
smartphone for the gym, so I don't have to worry about breaking or loosing 
it. An improvement I would like to see is the option to show a picture of 
the exercise instead of just the capital letter in the coloured circle 
while working out (like the jefit app). I keep confusing exercises because 
of this. With this change I would happily buy the app to get statistics but 
manly to support the developer.",4

notes to custom workouts and groups. 3. Ability to share custom workouts.

It's actually made my workout a bit more fun. Once I go through my schedule a couple times to be sure, I'll be buying Pro. Totally worth it.

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really easy to use, also with set workout programs that you can customise, in terms of rest lengths, sets, reps, exercises etc. It has most exercises on it, except for a few e.g. barbell hip thrusts.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Lost all my data recently, please help!",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great workouts, great tracker, and great design. Keep it up!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,No way to make super set and giant set excercises ... Please give that option,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is perfect in its simplicity. Add exercises from the extensive library or a custom one, list them in a workout, and then add them to a schedule. Or... Just pick a pre created schedule. Works well with a smart watch, so my phone can stay in my bag while at the gym. Tracks with Google fit so I can pair it with run tracking from another app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I use the app on smartwatch so I don't need my phone in gym. This is the best app I found so far.  For 5 stars please add small digital clock to countdown timer screen (easy fix, really useful).  For future I'd like to be able to choose, start and end session on smartwatch itself (bit more work I guess).",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is a really good tracking app but I wish there was a way to export individual sets and reps of each exercise rather just total reps and sets. Having individual exercise sets and reps would make it easier to monitor volume over time,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Perfect app. Only wish it has Samsung gear app.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Absolutely amazing. Must own for people of any gym habit,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Developer is responsive and let me know there is an update coming soon. Originally I claimed I did not receive a reply from the developer but it ended up in my spam. Excited to see what's to come.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Works great for tracking my custom sets etc, also works nicely on my android watch. Only negative is that although it does send the workout info into Google Fit, it doesn't register as a workout and subsequently doesn't get picked up by My Fitness Pal app.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a great, no mess workout app that let's you customize your workouts, select from a predefined set, and track your progress. Developer was also responsive when I had an inquiry.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app. Used several others but this one give you me the most flexibility in making my routines. I like to do 3 full body days a week  and label phase 1 day1/day2/day3. I just add notes under exercise week2 add a set or week 4 60% of max and so on.  Then next month phase 2....so you get the point. Just one way to be able to program multiple routines in if that's your preference. If there's an exercise note in library, it's easy to create and then you are good. Wish there was a way to export to excel or my Google account (there might be but I haven't found it yet). Overall great app.  If I could add anything it would be a phase function. Like I stated above program a routine then set it up based on weeks so each week reps/sets change accordingly. Then it automatically bumps you to your phase 2 routine that's programed (each routine needs to be able to have different workouts-mon/wed/fri-or whatever schedule you pick then sets/reps/wt changes for each week). I know that's something easy you guys could add....just in case you were bored one day.           Thanks for your work on this app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I loved it until all my progress was somehow erased...,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've tried so many workout apps, and so many have some features that are cool, only to be let down by e.g. not having the ability  to customise workouts, terrible u.i., no rest period timer. This finally has everything you need. Recommended.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great for what it does!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app has been by my side for the past half a year (after realising that paper and pen was not the most optimal way to track things), and it's been a pleasure to use - from the rest timer to just keeping record of lifts and commenting what went wrong/what went right. The 1rm calculations seem to be a bit high, but it gives me more hope haha",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Absolutely the best weight tracker, easy to use.  Flexible and clean app.  I would highly recommend it.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've used this app for a little over a year. I bought the paid version partly because I wanted the other features but mostly because the free app just SO GOOD. Zoltan, you did a fantastic job and I want to say thanks.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Trying this out as an alternative to jeFit.  So far, I like it as a simpler solution with the big plus of syncing to Google Fit.    One suggestion would be to allow users to manually enter Calorie burns for cardio exercises as an alternative to the default of Calories per Hour.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great simple little app. Regularly updated and no clutter. Has everything I need.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Calories burned is a function of the duration of the workout 👎,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Any way to upload a workout schedule from a csv?,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best gym tracking app around. Just needs to add an adaptive icon and app shortcuts when long pressing icon on home screen and it'll be 5 stars.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love this app! But, no glutes? I can't even add a custom exercise as they aren't listed as a muscle group. Or am I maybe missing something?",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Been using this app for over two years to track and plan. Integral part of my physical therapy program, couldn't do without it. Finally upgraded to the paid version as a show of thanks: the free version is also amazing!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The app reley on several app working together not what I am looking for...,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, i have tried quite a few workout trackers and I keep coming back to this one. I wish there was a way to set up workouts so that you could program in a few full day of workouts and then create your workout based around plugging in the days to your schedule. For example I am on a workout that goes ""ABA"" the first week, and ""BAB"" the second week. It would be nice to be able to create two days of workouts then set it up in a schedule as opposed to manually configuring every workout for the two week period.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really great, lots of customization for workouts.  Seems to be a bug with Google Fit and Android Wear. If I log my reps with my watch it doesn't seem to sync with Google Fit.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Would be 5 stars but its not free. The features that are, are great. May buy the full version because I really like this app! F it, 5 stars.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is what I've been looking for for years! Takes the pain out of tracking workouts and knowing what weight you need to be doing to progress from pervious sessions. The stats are invaluable too. It works best if you have a set schedule that you follow, so you don't need to create a brand new workout each time.  The only reason for not quite hitting the 5 star, is because when you enter a manual workout afterwards (rather than tracking as you workout) it can cause Google fit data to corrupt - I've submitted a report so hoping it will get fixed. Once done it will hands down make this the perfect app to support strength training.  (Paying for the full version is definitely worth it!)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app.  My only issue is that creating a new workout plan takes forever and there is no way to keep them if you change devices or have to reinstall the app and there is no way to share workout plans.  If they could make everyone have a log in profile that you could save your workouts to, this would solve the issue.  This could also help to be able to share a workout plan.  I always work out with my girlfriend and if we are going to do a new workout plan, we each have to spend about 20 minutes plugging in each exercise.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best strength tracking app I've used. Would love to see a web counterpart to make it quicker and easier to create/edit schedules.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Would really want to be able to add an exercise to multiple supersets (so that I can do a superset of three sets with A, B and then a superset of three sets with A, C)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is THE workout app. One point t to improve: instead of calories based on time, estimate calories based on weight lifted (like weight * length).",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, does everything I need it to, and the support from the developer is excellent!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I love this app for tracking my lifts. You can program your own schedules and even exercises. I highly recommend this app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is an amazing app. I'm kinda a geek for data and tracking progress, and I love the feature of tracking my previous workouts so I can force myself to try harder to keep that number going up over time. I also really like how I can fine tune my workouts from the templates to make them exactly  what I want; the only thing that would make it better is the ability to design my own exercise, because (for example) I like to do some sorts of body weight exercises which aren't always in the catalogue.  It's well worth the $7ish to unlock for the cool graphs too -- I find it keeps me motivated.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Does not sync to Google drive. Lost all of my workouts when I switched phones. Move to another app that actually works,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Fantastic app. Loads of pre loaded workouts, great instructions and diagrams of the exercises (some exercises dont have diagrams), customisable to let you make up your own routine. Highly recommended.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It fulfills my needs. Works pretty good with bodyweight strength training thanks to custom created exercises.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Cannot leave notes for workout. App crashes,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Please make it independent of the phone so that you can start your workout from the smartwatch. At he moment I have to start it on the phone then I can continue on the watch. I will then give it 5 stars. I even bought it to support you! Kind regards,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I am using the app with Huawei 2 watch, only used twice so still figuring out some of the steps.  This is a very good app to follow the workouts on phone  or watch which is why I tried it out.  I would recomend to anyone to use.  Only issue is it woudl be great to be able to limit the routines to specific type of equipment like Dumbells and Bodyweight only.    Update: great app still like it as using no regrets.  Sure would like routine by available equipment even though one can  change the routines very easily. Thinking of going pro just to motivate developer to keep up the good work!!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Has a slight bug involving the rest timer. The timer fails to actually ring, but changes the volume of whatever is playing on my Bluetooth headphones. Also tends to crash progression/the rest timer.  My only true gripe with this app is that the running on treadmill exercise doesn't store seconds. Despite having a place to specify seconds, it only stores the time to the nearest minute.  Lastly, I wish this app could sync with the Samsung health app!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app for StrongLifts like training! Would love bigger fonts all around for those of us who don't have our glasses at the gym.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I lost all my progression when I had no storage anymore. So android deleted caches. But thanks to backup and restore, I have restored everything!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I've used jefit and multiplier other workout trackers and none of them have every feature I wanted except this one.  The developer promptly got back to me with a question I had and also said that he is still working on the app which is great considering many other apps aren't still being worked on. Highly recommend.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is my favorite workout app. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it no longer works with my Android smart watch. While downloading on the watch I keep getting an error message saying that I need a Bluetooth connection. Read online that this message appears for apps that are not compatible with Android Wear 2.0. Please make it compatible with Wear 2.0. Still works pretty well on the phone though.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, the workflow is seamless which is what you want in the gym. However I was expecting a bit more from the statistics section, given it is a paid upgrade.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app! I've been using Fitocracy and FitNotes in the past but this app is simple, yet incredibly useful. Best fitness logging app I've used so far.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is hella good,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love this app, easy to create and track your exact workout",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is THE best android app for tracking your progress (hence the name) if you are lifting weights at the gym! Very easy to use, intuitive, clean design, very complete set of predefined exercises (you can create your own). Will buy the paid version for sure in short notice! Congratulations!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, bought the pro version and waiting to use it after I finish the current run on my program -When you create a exercise you should.be able to select multiple choices at time/weight (for example timed farmer's walk) or a weighted plank. -You should be able to select multiple equipment too like a speed deadlift with bands.  -Can a copy schedule option be added? If I like some routine and want to tweak some exercises it'll be easier to just copy and change something. -A share option for the workouts and schedule?",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Truly amazing app! I used to use Redy Gym but have been pulled away by all of the thoughtful little features of Progression Tracker. I love that when I complete a set, it moves on to the next exercise, the rest timer is a floating holo button, so if I leave the app, the timer is still visible, and the ease of building and updating my own program is amazing. And that's all just in the Free version. Statistics and graphs of your progress can be unlocked in the Pro version if you desire. But the core features are all Free which is just fantastic! I am definitely upgrading and the dev truly deserves it. Thanks a ton Zoltan!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The best fitness app I have ever used. No ads , slick user interface and awesome backup options. Integration with Google fit and so easy to use.   Strongly recommend.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Totally wiped out my schedules and I'm not able to save them anymore very disappointed because I paid for the premium service,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The ability to quickly set up your own routine, complete with supersets, drop sets, etc. is extremely handy. The interface is also very clean and easy to use, and having the charts of your lifting progress in-app and available to look at any time is awesome.   HOWEVER. I should note that paying for the app to get the ""export"" feature is pointless. The only thing that is exported from the app is your TOTALS for each day. So if you were hoping to look at your progress over time in a specific exercise, say squats, using nicer graphing tools on a desktop computer, the only way to do that is manually looking through your logs and typing it yourself :(. If the app is updated to export all your data for each lift to .csv and not just totals, I would definitely increase the rating to 5 stars.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The best workout app for the gym to track your weight increases and progress,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love this app. Been using it for over a year now. I highly recommend it.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app which it was compatible with to use on my Samsung gear 3,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is great, especially for setting up your own workout routine. The only thing keeping it from five stars is the weights are in kg only - which is fine by me, but since I'm in American gyms, half the weights only have lbs on them and that means I have to do the translation.  Give it the option to switch from kg to lb and it'll be perfect.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Got me going to the gym! Would be helpful if it has ""DONT DO"" pointers for some workouts, like stuff that could lead to injury or just do more harm than good.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Im just starting and I know its going t keep track of my workout,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"If you're into weightlifting and need the ultimate tracking app, look no further. The level of detail and ease of use is just incredible. This has clearly been carefully designed by a bodybuilder for bodybuilders.",5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"For some time the problems with disappearing workouts and schedules was solved by syncing with Google Drive. But now I can't force the app to sync, so I can't download backed up workouts from Drive.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Hello, one question. I just recently switched my phone to an LG G5 and still have the full paid version of the app. However one thing that has been really annoying me is that on my old device, it used to show the rest timer in a little small circle so I can exit the app and tend to other things on my phone while knowing how much time I have left.  However with this phone, the mini rest-timer isn't showing anymore; I tried playing around with the settings and what not and none of them seemed to bring up the rest timer. If you could please help me with this it would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, works amazingly compared to other fitness I have used. Easy to track your workout, create new ones and see what you had done in the last workout. Loads of great features put this above the rest.. can't recommend it enough, also great customer support 👍",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Back to working again, had to purge data. Pretty great tracking app",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is the most underated app I've found.  You can tell it was developed by someone who has spend many hours in the gym. It is superbly polished, customizable, and intuitive. The best workout app I've found, and I've tried way to many...",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Good app. Helpful for tracking progress.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app has pretty much everything you need - pre-made templates, the ability to create your own training template, statistics galore (charts, 1RM, rep maxes, etc) for all your informational needs.  Very easy to work within, you'll pick up how the app works within a day of using it. Definitely worth getting if you take your training seriously - especially for powerlifters who want to track their daily volume/tonnage as well as statastics.  Would recommend 100x over.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have a suggestion. You should be able to track 2 excercise at the same time, for example, i do 2 excercises at once, and i dont know when my rest time is over for the one, so I rest too long sometimes, just a suggestion😉",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The App looks really good but I don't understand how it works with Android Wear 2.0.   It doesn't show up in my watch?  Will pay if I can get it to work on my watch.  Update: Figured it out, you have to perform soft reset on watch (turn it off then on) and it will show up in play store as an app you can install on watch.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app. Been using this every day now, and it suits my workout needs. Had a question, mailed the dev and he replied quickly, good thing. You can add your own exercises or select them from a list, the only thing I needed was a dark-mode, which is coming soon. 10/10.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have been trying this over a week and it suits my needs very well. The selection of exercises is good, although not complete. Integration with Google Fit works well, which is a requirement for me. I'm considering buying in for the premium features.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app. Have had the pro version for a while. The only thing I would like to see is a way to share your workout schedule with other users.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Awesome workout tracking app! Simple and easy to use!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It's really good but the calorie count is totally bogus - it's just by the time you spend working out. Also you need to add cardio here...i always finish off my workout  I with a walk/run and I  I would love to add it to my  workout. My bf and I work out together, he lifts much more than me and ways much less but our calorie count is always the same.....improve calorie counter and add cardio and I'll give it 5 stars",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I really like this app but I'm not entirely sure the upgrade was worth it but since I used it so much I went ahead and got it. The calorie count is way off and is just based on time exercising. This is a pretty important feature that should be fixed in the future.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is the best fitness app I have used. It is great to keep track of progress per exercise. You can easily see your one rep max and the stats from your previous workouts rep.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Easily the best strength training tracker I have found to date. Simple but effective user interface.  Would love the option to have your weights default to values from the last occurrence of a session, rather than the last occurrence of a movement, but that is just nitpicking. Will definitely be upgrading.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This app has everything you need to easily create and record workouts.  You can see your progress through stats.  My fav part is the timer you can setup so you know when it is time to lift again. Thanks for an awesome app! The dev does respond if you have any questions/issues.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"IMHO the best app for developing and tracking your workouts, exercises and muscle groups. Comes preloaded with workout plans and exercise details. Dev is very responsive and continues to improve the app. UI is perfectly designed for use between sets. Lots of useful options to customise behaviour. Highly recommended!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It's ok.  I'm sure this app is great for some.  But, for me I have found a different app preferable.  I would say give it a try.  Another person in my position may have chosen this app.",3

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've gone through a lot of notebooks and apps over the years, and this is the one I've been looking for. Clean, intelligent UI that's easy to use and stays out of your way so you can focus on why you came to the gym.  Money well spent.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Thats good app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Does not allow me to add a second collection of sets of the same exercise. I run through two cycles of the same set of exercises, but the second time I change the weight. EDIT: 5 stars for quick response from Dev. I will definitely redownload once the feature is added!",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really happy with this app.  I've tried a few similar apps but was either too complex or too inflexible for my needs.  Progression is easy to use, flexible and great for in depth tracking.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app.  Works perfect and simple to use.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Awesome app! Please add option to add plates and quantity, I have a home gym and also 50lbs is not available in the options.  Also please add an in app RM calculator so i don't have to use other app to calculate RMs. And it will be more awesome if the RM calculator is available beside the input weight so when you calculate RMs and chose to use weight in a certain percentage you can just click it and it will populate the text box of weight input :)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really nice app.  I use it all the time.  The built in routines are fine, but I (like most I would bet) create my own.  Good selection of exercises, and is easy to add your own. The UI is nice, and very stable.   This is one of the fist apps I purchased when I switched from IOS to Android, and one of the best.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"App works great on my phone but doesn't appear to work as the pictures indicate it should on my Gear2.

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Revised review: amazing app, best for workouts.   Review before revision: Amazing app,  i think,  I have purchased a pro version,  but since I moved to another phone and installed progression body,  progression keeps erasing my workout history and plans.

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love the app! Will give 5 stars when there are more exercises added in the ""300"" they have listed are very generalized so half of my workout I'm writing down in the notes section and therefore can't track. Also would love to see stretches added in!",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is exactly what I have been looking for. Has a great list of pre assembled weekly workouts for all types. There is a demo of each exercise in case you don't know what one of them is.  My only problem is there are some common exercises I would like to see in here including boxing types, jump rope etc.  You are able to add an exercise but I would love to see an area for suggestions where you can officially have them added. Going to upgrade cause it's worth the money.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've been a long time Jefit user, but this app made me switch! Beautiful interface and android wear support",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best fitness app I've used! Honestly a worthwhile download for anyone in the gym.,5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Such a great app that I bought the paid version. The app has lost my data once, which was upsetting but can be understood (when it transitioned from beta to alpha).",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Amazing app, I was using the 5x5 stronglifts app before but it doesn't allow much customization. With this app you can customize all your workouts and save different types. And the tracking is very detailed.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Very easy to use, highly customisable and intuitive. Best lifting app I've tried.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Perfect for my needs! I especially like being able to change exercises on the fly. If completing sets via the notification drawer can be added in the near future, I'll definitely purchase the pro version!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app. Upgraded to Pro version. But why do you have a separate Progression Tracker Pro which has integration with Dropbox instead of Google Drive? It's confusing. Why are there 2 versions? Also you might consider forced syncing to Google fit as I realise some if my data in progression did not sync with Fit which is weird. Or would you have any suggestions on how I can have that fixed?,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Would be better with a line graph showing progression in lifts,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app and fantastic support from the dev,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It's really great and easy to use.  It integrates with Google fit and wear devices as well.  Probably the beating easiest app to use while at the gym.  Hoping to see continued work.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I'd love to use this app, but the workouts I do refuse to complete. I have tried everything and they keep popping up after workout saying to resume. Any chance there's a fix? HTC 10  Update: After 36 hours, the save button appeared. I managed to edit the real time for my workout and other than that, very impressive and customizable workout app. Thank you Zoltan!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Very good app. Has helped motivate me to work out harder and more frequently. I wish it let me put in minutes and seconds for running.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Props to the dev... the pro upgrade was a no-brainer.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app in most ways, but this app constantly uninstalls itself from my phone without warning or notification.   UPDATE: The uninstall bug was solved by moving the app from SD storage to internal storage. The developer reached out to me and told me how to fix the problem.",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love this app, especially the integration with Android Wear... Saves me having to unlock my phone after every set and it's great that the rest timer automatically fires after each set and vibrates to let me know it's time for the next set.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Only good if you purchase upgrade.,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I like the app a lot but wish the calorie calculator for the cardio activities would take your entered weight into account or allow for you to manually enter it from the total the machine says.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Amazing app. Very intuitive and user-friendly. They have a large database of exercises and it's fully customizable. Syncs with Google fit... I'm excited to see where this goes in the future,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"A pleasure to use. Two usability requests: 1. Ability to set equipment weight without going into plate calculator. My workout uses bars of different weights, and having to change the equipment weight for each excercise all the time is annoying. 2. Custom available plates. I live in a metric country. The available plates are 2k, 3k, 5k, 10k. The preset available plates are close but not quite. Being able to customize them to fit a gym setup will be nice. Other than these 2 points I have no more complaints. Perfect user experience otherwise 👌💯",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Nice app to plan and track your workouts, either existing or custom exercises. Missing features in my opinion: ability to set the timer to ring after X seconds or minutes (e.g. I don't want look at my phone when holding a plank) / ability to add a description to each step individually (e.g. Step 1 is left leg up, step 2 right leg up, etc.)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is the best strength training app that I've used. The automatic rest timer is great and I like the stats that it provides after your workout. Great app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a fantastic app works well with me watch as well, so as a newbie to the world of the gym this is a life saver and pro is great upgrade as well.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I try to use this app but it won't let me give it access... dont know if it is a glitch or what. If the app developer fixes this my review will change, but until then it will stay.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Finally a simple workout tracking app, clean and simple. Easy to use. A couple requests: add a rest timer between exercises. For example I rest 1:30 between sets and 3:00 between exercises. The ability to share routines with other user would be cool too. Thank you!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Perfect material design and a fantastic app all-around. I use it every time I hit the gym.   One suggestion is when you complete an exercise and are on to a different day or workout, I'd love a ""suggested weight"" entry rather than just the same one you already completed. For instance, if I squat 200 lbs 5 times, then two days later I go to squat again it would be nice if it said 205 or 210 based on the last workout I did. Of course it would still be editable.  Thanks!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, compared to others. Would be nice to include sprint training with reps as an exercise, though. Keep up the good work!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really like the app. Good setup. Would've given it 5 stars if I was able to add my own exercises that are not on the list in the app. Please do an update to add exercises to library.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great App. Very wide array of exercises. One thing I'd like to do is to copy a workout schedule once I create it. Alot of schedules are similar but have tweaks. That would be a great improvement. Otherwise very happy with it.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. I wish there was an option to save any routine from the history as my routine which can be selected quickly next time.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Using this after having used another lifting  app for many years. I really like the simple look of this app and the floating count down, and it syncs with Google Fit.   I think the app does lack some features I'd like to see. For example, I'd like to see if I set a new weight record during my rep (not on a stat page later). Also, I'd like to assign a day to a workout like ""Back - Monday"" instead of just Day 1, Day 2, etc. Also, I'd like to see more exercises in the database, and actual images of the workout instead of a colored letter. I'd upgrade for all that!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great App. Very useful only wish there was a way to display the reps previously setup in Schedules for each set on the wear app. Then the app can go to the reps/weight instead of starting at 0 each time you enter a set.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Ok, so I had given this 2 stars because it wasn't able to save after the workout. The developer Zoltan is brilliant. He knew something I had forgotten which impaired Progression from working: I turned off animations on my Nexus 6P many moons ago. I just started working out again and couldn't save it this go round. Now after my workout, the save button appears ... magic. Crisis averted. I do not have to use crappy competitor products. This is the best workout app out there and it syncs with Google Fit.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,My favorite fitness tracker app! Would be cool to be able to set a range for the rest timer (ex. 2-3 minutes) where it beeps twice.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Hey; I love this app but want to be able to log the weights I did. I am more then willing to pay $5 to upgrade but which upgrade do I get to log the weights I use? Thanks.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Adding another review, cannot say enough about Zoltan and this app. The best thing for anyone who wants to track their gym progress, make custom programs, and analyze their progress. Outstanding work, and quick developer response times. Simply amazing! Thanks for everything Zoltan, means alot to everyone and the fitness community",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Could easily have been a 5 if it were not for the very disappointing upgrade path. The issue is that to track your weight, you need a SEPARATE app, for which you need to pay AGAIN to upgrade. And when all added, these ""group of apps"" becomes ridiculously expensive. IMO, shouldn't be needing to pay extra to get proper weight tracking when other apps just have it built in.  P.S. More than happy to give this a 5 if a more reasonable upgrade path is setup in the future.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, wish there was a way to add custom plate weights.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love this app. Great design, easy and fast to use, and even really informative with the guides.  Had an issue where I lost my progress but that was due to my phone. Thank you for the reply Dev.",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Was working great and looked like a great app. Then it randomly deleted the workout I created, as well as my workout history. :(",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"UI is amazing, easy to use ! Importing workouts from CSV/JSON file would be awesome. Nevertheless,amazing app overall ! No bugs :D",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great all around app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I need help. I already purchased the paid version for this but when I did a restore factory setting, It showed that I need to pay again.   Unlike other apps, they have the word ""purchased"" on the ""install"", but this one I need to buy again? Why?",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Absolutely love this app. Couldn't be without it now. Well worth the funny price tag to get premium.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Just fantastic tracking capabilities both during and out of workouts. The standalone feature for Android Wear allows me to leave the phone in the wardrobe.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app that has helped me stick to working out. Can easily schedule a workout and modify it to fit my needs. Really like the simplicity of it.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Will not save if Stamina Mode is active. The issue has apparently been known for a month, but sadly still isn't fixed.",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Having tried several similar apps, this is by far the best. A nice addition could be for a notification to come and tell you when you have made 'progression' and done a new personal best.... Can you please make a version that can be used on the Samsung gear s3 watch. There is nothing anywhere near as good on that app store at the moment. Thanks",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app! It can be even better with a larger catalogue of exercises with visuals included 😊,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, but it lacks some in logging cardio exercises. If a setting for custom workouts was added where weight could be changed to distance and time to minutes (or minutes and seconds), I think that would be a great improvement.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Has everything that I love from the other fitness apps that I've used in the past all rolled into one. Simple to learn, visually well done app. Wish I would've found it sooner. While it is a 5 star app for me, I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that visually it would be nicer to see symbols of the body parts. Also there are some exercises that have incorrect pictures depicting how to do them. It'd be nice to be able to change the pictures as well as some of the descriptions.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Tried most of the gym apps and they all fell short, this one ticked all the boxes. This is a well thought out app. Great work developer 😌",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Awesome, simple where it needs to be and complex where it needs to be, Google fit integration is awesome, as well as the Android wear support.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Sir Zoltan, i personally think this app is the best fitness progress tracker in play store. But one little major thing that decrease the app efficiency is that some descriptions and illustrations is either wrong or repetitive. For example, cable crossover with straight angle shows high to low illustration. Another is single arm dumbell press dictates hold one dumbbell with each hand. Please fix this sir Zoltan. And I will be planning to upgrade to pro version soon. Otherwise, it's still a 5-star rating for me.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Amazing app, I really like the design",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Fantastic UI! I purchased a moto 360 sport to help track my fitness. This app turns your android wear into the perfect weight lifting companion.  the phone app is very intuitive and uses material design perfectly.  I hope your app keeps updating and rolling out out new features. I have a few suggestions and personal requests for the app where is the best place to request these?,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app for tracking workouts. Love the ability to see past exercises on next workout. Is it possible to modify the countdown timer to add the ability to enter the timer countdown using the keyboard rather than having to rotate the indicator on the dial?,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app. Lots of exercises, good little art on many showing how they can be done, as well as descriptions, and links to YouTube videos. The material design makes the UI flawless and beautiful. Great summary/statistics. Just overall the best workout tracking app I've used.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Beautiful and functional app. Bravo!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"best progression logger out there. before this i was stagnant for like a year, in a few months I've made 2 years worth of gains.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,💩 don't see how it makes me a winner at the gym or even in life,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a great app.  Many built in schedules and exercises, but also the ability to create your own.  The only thing that might make it better would be a web interface that would allow for creating/managing workouts.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is the best application for tracking any weight lifting based routine. I am at over 250 workouts with it and cannot recommend it enough.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Intuitive interface. Packed with features. You have to measure to progress!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I love the simplicity of use but at the same time the complex statistic analysis. Syncs with googlefit and backs up everything on the cloud.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great weightlifting App, but would love to see more options for exporting data. E.g.: Being able to export deadlift progression over time.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Won't let me finish a workout and keeps notifying me i have a workout in progress.        Edit: Battery saver stops the save from appearing. Other than that a fantastic app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have downloaded and tried many, many of the workout logs and fitness apps and could not find one that would allow me to schedule my own workouts to my calender, also this allows you to do supersets and has programs to follow that are very helpful. Sorry no videos just pics, but If you know how to do the exercise with proper form it's very it's easy to follow. There is a timer for rest periods. Many apps had similar functions but lacked in one area or another. Definitely recommend this app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love this app. Two things though: it seems to sync with Fit only after a workout is completed. Since I don't have service in my gym, the sync fails and the only way to sync later is to log out and log back in. Wish there was a manual sync or a way to set automatic syncing every x hours. Also, wish there was a way to prevent Android wear screen from turning off. When doing any timed exercise, it's so frustrating when the screen turns off and you can't see the clock",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I would give 5 if my completed workouts would save and not stay stuck in resume after completing. I have to delete them due to no other alternative to the issue.,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app with an up to date material design. Allows much for fine control over your rep/set planning than any other app I've used.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"To receive 5 stars the only thing missing is the recommended number of reps in Android Wear. If I say that an exercise should have 6-8 reps, it would be nice to be able to see this info on my watch. Please do this and I'll gladly give you 5 stars! Your program is perfect!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"nice little app to use with my moto sport 360 when Im weight lifting instead of cardio. One suggestion would be a companion windows sync to build routines and customs exercises. Doing it on the phone can be a bit cumbersome. Ive found the file in the apps folder that has the info but it seems to create a key for each exercise entered and of course that cant be generated. I was thinking of installing it on my tablet, using my keyboard to build up my routines and exercises and then re export the file to my phone.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Very useful for lifting at the gym. I love the Google fit connectivity, it makes tracking everything really easy. This app probably has hundreds mabye thousands of exercises, unfortunately I have to add my own frequently.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love how the app lays out and functions, however my workouts keep syncing back to the originals I created and I lose all my edits. Tried backing up and importing and that worked. Make sure you back up after edits. Otherwise this is a 10/10.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app has a great selection of programs and exercises, plus it's dead simple to use. Stats and sync are great features. But please: change that tag line on the play store. It's terrible!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is hands down the best gym app. It is everything that I ever wanted. Jfit is nothing. My main problem is losing data, I lost my data once because of an update which got me pretty pissed off. I started using Google drive sync so that I won't lose it again. This time I wiped my phone and when I synced Google drive it got my data from a month ago, a whole month of data gone. One last thing; why does the timer sometimes stop working, it made me reinstall the app many times to get it to work back again.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I use this app several times a week and I love that I am able to set up workouts for home and the gym. It has definitely helped with my weight loss goals!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great selection of workout schedules, Google Fit integration for caloric burn and weight tracking syncing, just what I was looking for!  I would love if custom schedules could be backed up to Google Drive as well. Also, it would be very convenient if a set could be marked as complete on the Android Wear device.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Without a doubt, the best weightlifting tracking app I've ever used ... and I've used a few. As a trainer, this is the first thing I recommend my clients download. Its the most intuitive way to keep track of your workouts, and it's so easy to use!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Beautiful, clean, and functional!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is great, I just wish there was a larger selection in muscles to choose from such as quads and hamstrings instead of just legs, etc.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Bought the app. Not different from the demo.. Complicated to use,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, would like to share programs with friends",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is just perfect. Create your workouts and exercises, timed or for weight exercise tracking. It allows for really easy inputs that flows with your workout. The rest timer is wicked. Take in account the analysis tracking and all the other features, i happy paid $10. Cheers guys",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Have bought pro version and worked great. but recently i change phone and Cant re - install it the app requests me to pay again,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I really like how there is actually a lifting app that syncs with google fit and my withings wifi scale, however there can be some improvements More workout plans would be nice! Maybe users could share workouts with each other or make them public for others to use. Can workouts in the history be added to a current plan after the work out is completed?",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Does exactly what you'd expect an app like this to do, plus very easy to use",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Edit: Bummed out the sync with drive isn't automatic. Forgot to export before wiping my phone. Gg 2 months of data. Previous: I hated jefit, stronglifts is only one program and fitness tracker was too complicated. Thankfully found progression. It's simple to use and fully customizable. UI could be more intuitive as it took a bit of figuring out.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"As good as a fitness log app can be, kudos.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Tried to download all images for exercises all of the exercises don't have images,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"no need to look anywhere else. I've tried a bunch of the mainstream apps, i liked them but progression is by far the best. Dev also replies to emails personally.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I was looking for something to replace the guided workouts I used to use on an Microsoft Band 2 now that I switched to an Android Wear device.  This app does a pretty good job replacing that, telling you what exercise to do, timing your rest, and letting you develop your own workout plan.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Keeps me motivated,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Its probably the best app for tracking exercises. Could you add kg for specific exercises though? Deadlifts have to be in kg for me and everything else needs to be in pounds,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The app takes a long time to update,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Was using fitnotes which is very good in its own right, but Progression is far and away the best fitness tracker in terms of UI and polish. Wear support is just icing on the cake! Developer also responds quickly to feedback. Excited to see this app evolve. I don't even need the premium features but I have no issues spending money to support talented devs like Zoltan. Also shout out to reddit where I first saw this app mentioned in the comments.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. I use it daily at the gym.  Suggestion: feature to export and import workout schedules to and from other users perhaps?,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Use it daily. It has features I didn't know I wanted. Everything just works!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really good app, has almost everything I would want. However, I'd like the ability to add the same exercise to two different groups of supersets if possible.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Also last update deleted my schedule, for everyone who has this problem your workout days are in history. Overall very good app! Please fix this!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,But is there a way to add an exercise multiple times per workout? I have the pro version.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,A really easy to use and powerful tool. Took a bit to get used to navigating but once setup couldn't be easier. It's ad free which is really refreshing,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, but unfortunately I updated the app and my schedule was deleted. Again. It's in the history, so I can at least continue my schedule today by repeating days through the history, but not sure I want to go through setting up my schedule in this app again vs just looking for an alternative. It's not the first time it's happened.",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"That really annoying that my local exercise plans now are gone. Edit: seems like the app imported my Google Drive backup and wrote on top on my local changes, so my local stuff (which I hadn't backed up) is now lost 😨",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Perfect fitness app graphical accurate a bit clunky here and there but still perfect.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is exactly what I wanted.   It's straightforward to use.  It has a clean and simple interface.  It has go descriptions of the exercises and links to YouTube videos demonstrating the exercises.  This is the no frills workout app that I've been looking for.  Best of all, it takes very little space in my smartphone's memory.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Awesome app, Android Wear integration is working again, my main reason for owning the sony smartwatch 3.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The notification at the end of the rest time is being played through the phone speaker even in silence mode.  EDIT: unfortunately I am having the same problem yet and I found another bug. When not doing the exercises following the default order (and for instance you start with the last one from that day), after ending the last set of the exercise, it is displaying ""Complete workout"" instead of ""Next exercise"" option.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Clean minimal UI, easy to use and has great features as well. Been looking for an app like this for ages. Thanks developer!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a great app that has consolidated quite a few of my other fitness apps into one. One minor request though: would it be at all possible to add a per-set weight setting? As in, a weight option to go alongside 'min/max reps' when adding sets. Great app, otherwise!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"With progressive overload being the key pillar to gaining strength/muscle, this app is extremely useful to me. Great interface: Minimalist, clean, well designed and stable. Using it for every workout to track progress.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Needs integration with Pebble and-or Garmin, and this would be the perfect App.  The best and easiest weight training app I've found. It's easy to set up a workout and even change on the fly for a session. Could use a warm up section as part of each exercise.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This app is worth the purchase! It has the best inbuilt apps and one can create/edit their own workouts and even set plate loading and timers! Very helpful!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've tried a few workout trackers in the past, but this is the best! Very clean UI, easy to use and simple to change things around.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Same issue for me. I like the app a lot,  but it took me a while to enter my individual workout schedule and the next time I wanted to access it in the gym it was erased.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. I upgraded to pro version as it gives you way more insight and statistics to track your progress.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Awesome app works with my smart watch just needs a homescreen widget,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Backup data to Google drive check!  Export data to csv check!  Inbuilt timer,  exercises and stats check!  Responsive dev who actually responds to your email check!  This is my go to gym tracler app",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"After trying several workout apps this one was exactly what I needed. A very simple, material design inspired UI, a highly customizable and informative workout schedule, and great workout analytics so I can track my progress over time. It only took me one workout session to purchase the upgraded version. Thank you for making this app!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The app is great but the addition of a calendar view as well as more strongman type exercises in the database would make the app even better.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Simplicity is what I was looking for and simplicity is what this app offers.   Keep up the great work!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Everything is great, but every time I edit my workout routine, it somehow reverts back to the original. I can't find a way to fix it.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It would be perfect if it had a weight tracker.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Very easy to use app to track workouts and keep track of rest periods!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Perfect material design. Recording workouts well. Great integration with Google fit etc.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Easy to use and very functional,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best fitness tracker in the store. Lots of options, exercises with explanations and pictures. And Google drive and Fit integration.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Good solid app. Would love to export with free version.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I rarely if ever rate apps but this one is done so well and worth supporting the developer. He gets what features you actually need and has designed the ux to give you access to exactly what you need at the right time. Ive looked for years for an app that does this. Tried them all. This really is the best.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a good app. If you have a consistent workout schedule, this is a great app to track your progress. It takes some time to setup but afterwards you'll be off and running",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love this app, the only problem I do have is if I want to edit a program, it won't save. When I actually go to do the workout, it was what it was previously, even though I edited the workout changing half of it earlier in the day. It was a huge inconvenience, as I realized this at the gym. That is my only complaint.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is perfect for tracking your workouts and progress without any other crap built in!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Easily the best app for the gym I've used...and I've used many. Since getting an Android Wear watch last month it's even better not having to carry my phone around the gym. The only issue I am having is that it doesn't sync to Google Fit until I log out of Google Fit in the app and then log back in, at which point it syncs. I've read other reviews with the same issue. Please fix! Still, great app!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Just want to say, fantastic app. Appreciate your work. One of the only apps I have never regretted purchasing premium, if nothing else to support dev. My only request would be customisation wise, maybe let us choose the apps primary and accent colours. Perhaps let us change the slide out menu Top image. Thank you",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really good app for tracking workouts, whether their known programs or something you made up yourself. The only thing missing is a calendar view to see history of workouts quickly.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best workout tracker app on the market. It has everything you need.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I even got the pro version. Works perfectly well. Was going to ask the developer to include starting strength in the preset routines but realised that the complexities of staring strength makes that impossible,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Design and ease of use is fantastic. By far the best app to get through lifting without having to fumble through your phone to figure out what's going on. For lifting I struggle to use it because it's difficult to enter in workouts if you are progressing based on percentages of 1RM. A little more in depth overall for the weight lifting side would be incredible.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Where is the Overhead Press?  Needs more animations... with the correct form.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Links to YouTube are too time consuming to look at during a workout and instead I'd like to see it replicate JEFIT with integrated GIF images showing the exercises. Needs more exercises too as it's a little lacking.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I really love this app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Out of the fitness apps I have used, this one is my personal favorite. I use it every time I go lifting. It has a ton of programs to choose from right off the bat, has detailed descriptions of your workouts, and is clean and simple. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to get to their goals.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Excellent app. It provides exactly what I was looking for after having used a physical book to track my workouts. Easy to use, provides a rest timer, and makes it really easy to see your progress in the different lifts. One minor hiccup has been that when I changed devices approximately a week after I started using it it only synced one of my ~5 previous workouts, and I've been unable to import them.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Excelent user interface, intuitive and beautiful. The app lacks exercises, such as cable tricep kickbacks or lying tricep extension (only has seated). Would buy if the developer added a more completed database of exercises. EDIT: The lack of common exercises such as calf raises or hip thrust makes me give this app 3 stars.  It should at least have the option to add custom named exercises.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The personal lifting app to beat. Beautiful design, no social nonsense.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,A real pleasure to use. Very well thought out ux. Product managers have a lot to learn from this simple app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app - added my own PPL routine and it tracks everything nicely. I bought the paid version as it works so well with my workouts and my need for statistics.  Would be 5 stars, but I have an issue where it is not syncing my workouts with Google Fit, which is what I wanted to do. I have searched online for fixes but cannot find anything. Hoping that Zoltan could give me a reply to help me out? I have linked it correctly in Progression, but it is not showing in the linked apps on Google Fit.  Also, a suggestion - please add the ability to add the same exercise twice in a workout. I superset the same exercise twice in one workout and I can't add it twice. Had to create another exercise to be able to see it in the app.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Would love to add the same exercise twice to the same workout and list seems incomplete, but otherwise amazing app",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Good app for making and keeping a schedule.  Being able to replace an exercise on the fly would be great.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Perfect fitness tracking app.  Great customization and syncing.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I just hope it had ability to change statics, I mean I want to make that all exercise show one rep Max but if I want it, I have to change it one by one",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Does the job with simplicity and ease.  Very efficient, intuitive, clean and un-bloated app with. Has Google Fit integration and it looks good too.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I really like this app. It's user friendly, and has almost every feature that I could want in a fitness app. However, I really wish this had a weight tracker like the Stronglifts 5x5 app has, and I also wish if had an option to use a line graph  for statistics portion.

Both have responsive developers, both have analysis, easy way to track lifts, routines, graphs for 1rm, volume, ratio of body, etc. This has integration with Google fit, the other have has set calculator (which I use). I have no idea, but this is really good (and ad free), so it comes down to what you want. Mainly for weight lifting, not for tracking cardio (but you can add to do cardio here).",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,He has replied everytime I have bothered him with silliest of questions. Thank you for such an amazing app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The whole Google Drive is a great idea but only when it's implemented well. And this is not. Deleted schedules keep coming back and my devices NEVER show the same list of schedules. Still my go to app tho. Still annoying tho.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is well designed and helps me just start working out! Step by step, efficient bodybuilding for all. Developer very responsive! If you have a Moto do NOT keep the app on external storage as it may cause it to delete itself daily.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I looked everywhere for a good workout app with Material Design, and this was the perfect find! It worked great for me the first month I've been using it, but just recently it's been having problems syncing with Google Fit (not sure if the fault lies with Google or not). Also, when introduced a friend to the app I realized it would be great if there was a way to share workout plans so we could've avoided having to find each exercise again from scratch. The ability",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Missing the ability to add the same workout more than once per session, great app otherwise.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Question.... How can I change to lbs. on Android wear?  It's setup as kg, and I can't figure out how to change it. Still the best workout app that I've tried by far",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Clean interface. But more features required to make it easy to use.. a. Delete / Edit Session b. Copy a day / set of exercises c. Better variety of in-built workout schedules along with an option to filter them with available equipment.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It was a great app.  With the new google fit, it does not sync progression workouts like it used to.  Please update with the new version of google fit for 5 stars.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I'm giving this a 5 but wish two things would  happen. 1.  Sync with s health. 2. Make a gear s2 app so my watch buzzes when rest is over. This developer rocks. I couldn't figure out how to add custom lifts and he told me how. That was one of my original complaints.  I really love that this is only available to us Android peeps, but bro you could make a ton of money selling this on iPhone. They don't have anything like this app in the app store.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,User friendly. I chose this over Jefit because after 2 years you still can't have a rep range or sync to Fit.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is the best workout tracking app I've used, but the new update has this floating rest timer and I can't find a way to turn it off. It's driving me nuts.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best fitness app by far that I've found! Has everything you could possibly need with an awesome interface!!! Good job devs!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Loved it,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I'd give it five stars if the export functionality included more information in the CSV. Ideally this would include each workout, the movements done, weights used, etc. I was hoping to make a website that syncs with the data and outputs a nice graph using d3. Let me know if that's in your plan. Otherwise fantastic and fast app. I used to use fitocracy but this is simpler, faster, and better.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Absolutely love this app for tracking my workouts. It's got a simple design and very easy to use. The one thing I HATE (would have been 5 otherwise) is how I can't use the same exercise twice in one routine. I would strongly recommend fixing this issue (unless I'm missing something). Often I will use an exercise a second time for a burn set and with this app I can't do that. I end up having to create a second exercise with a slightly different name which throws off my stats. Thanks in advance.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Incredible workout app!,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Excellent, easy to use app. Developer is quick to respond to issues.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This alongside myfitnesspal are my favourite apps that I use everyday.  Great job!  It would be nice if you could add more personalization features such as color ect,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I use this app every time I go to the gym. It helps me remember what workouts i have for the day and adjust them accordingly. Plus I want compare each set to my previous lifts!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Clean design which I love and does exactly what I was about to code myself. Am still testing but will probably upgrade,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I use this app every time I work out. I especially love the built-in workouts with the ability to customize on the fly. My only question is how are the calories calculated? If there was a way to add height and weight to make that more accurate that would make this nearly perfect! Thanks,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Can't say enough good things about this app. From a lifting perspective, this is absolutely the best fitness tracking app out there.  I have recommended it to many others and they love it too.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Fine for most things. HIIT Cardio doesn't work here cause you can't set up cardio sets, it seems to only work if you categorize it as a non-cardio exercise.  I'd also prefer an easier way to import custom exercises via a PC. It takes too long to make you're own exercises on the phone.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Tons of exercises and they link you to YouTube to see how it's done properly.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I like some of the features on here, especially the rep ranges for sets. The one issue that was a big turnoff is my schedule got erased after syncing to Google Drive. Fortunately, my history wasn't impacted, but it'll be a hassle to readd everything.",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I really like the app Would like to see cardio exercises included in workouts. Maybe age and weight details for more accurate calories burned would be good.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,What I've always wanted from a fitness app and more. Would be great to see it sync with other Android wear.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The only thing I would change is the icon. It doesn't really mesh with material design.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I created a custom workout on one device and when I opened the app on a different devices the workout didn't sync, both are connected to the same Google drive account. Also would be nice if i could preload a workout schedule onto my watch and start a workout directly from the watch rather than needing to start it from the phone. Otherwise seems very usable",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Not editable.,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,😭,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,What I've been looking for. Worth every penny,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love the app! Would love to be able to change the notification sound. When I'm working out, I never know if the timer is going off or whether I'm getting an email or something else. I find myself checking my phone constantly to make sure the sound I'm hearing isn't my rest timer going off.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Easily the best app for tracking your workout routine.  Even better, the developer is incredibly responsive!  I had a minor technical problem, and he got back to me within a few hours!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I went through at least 20 different workout apps and this is by far the best! Full control, easy access, beautiful graphic display of your progress, and doesn't screw you over with a requirement to pay 35 dollars a month to use the app once you've completed a 20 minute sign up process. I'd however add another feature or two exclusive for users who upgraded so that we'd feel it was worth it!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I want to use this app, but I'm missing the possibility to add something like my adviced starting weight to my training schedule. Like i need to do 12 reps with halters with 20kg, 10 reps with 22kg and 8 reps with 24kg and so on :) so I don't have to remember that :)",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I synced progression to Google Drive before I restored my phone and now all of my history and workoutss are gone. EDIT: I logged out of sync and back in and it fixed it. The app is perfect now!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Absolutely loving the app, it's the best that I have tried, and I have tried a lot. Love the simplistic and yet elegant material design, keeps things simple and to the point. Built in programs are both good for beginners and advanced lifters. Great insight analytics,would love to see more from that part of the app.for example giving out recommendations based on insights collected and etc. Great work, keep it up!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Thanks for prompt reply, let's figure out issue together",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Would be 5 stars if they spilt the leg section into Glutes, quads, calves and hamstrings. Otherwise it is simple to use and perfect for keeping track of my workouts.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Good app for quick recording of workouts,  has good number of exercises however lacks calendar integration, measurement recording,  ability to cancel a workout that is running etc.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best app to check your progress,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Absolute best if you are a serious lifter.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really like the app. Timer between sets is great. One thing I'd really like to have is the ability to swap out exercises within workout as I'm going. If the gyms busy I sub in exercises if equipment is taken (dumbell press vs Barbell, etc) id like to accurately track my progress without recording dumbell weights for Barbell exercises. Otherwise the app is fantastic",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've tried pretty much all of the gym apps and none match the simplicity and intuitiveness of this app. I can create my workout perfectly, track it easily, modify on the fly, make edits where I screw up and see the metrics I want to see. Works so well, you wonder why every app doesn't do it the way this one does.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Very well designed and easy to use, as well as up to standard with material guidelines.  It also carries a ton of very useful extra features including CVS export and Google Fit integration.  Neat!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Why does it need permissions for storage? Apps are given their own storage, so why is it asking for broader access?",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I use this app every time I go to the gym. If you have a great workout in mind just find them and add them to your custom workout schedule! Literally the best progression app even works on Android Watches I love it so so much!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really weird activity transitions. It isn't normal to have activities transition from the top.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Been using this a long time and it is great for tracking workouts. Very intuitive and easy to use. Only had one problem thus far and the developer was very quick and helpful in his responses.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Easy to use and got a nice design,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"He loves this app, we just have a question....how does he create a workout?",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great for tracking your workouts so you know exactly what progress you've made. It's also convenient to know how many calories you've burned after each workout for dietary reason. Additionally, the interface is fantastic and is the perfect example of material design.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Statistics are only available in the pro version. Also some common exercises don't have pictures which is unfortunate. Good layout and setup though.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best fitness app for android,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Wish it could connect to my Samsung gear 2 watch,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,But wish it was available for my Samsung Gear watch so I didn't have to carry my phone around constantly.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Loved this app until recently it reset and deleted over 3 months of workouts. I was synced with both Dropbox and Google drive, but as of yesterday it only sees one workout.",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"What an amazing app. I have tried many different ones and this by far takes the cake. An easy choice to pay for pro! A couple things i would love to see: Lock screen entry, import csv or similar of old workouts, ability to use lbs for weights and kms for cardio as two separate choices. Regardless, love the app and will continue to use it.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This app gives you everything you'll ever need to easily track your exercise program.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love this app, the design and the features it has are really good and its helped me start going to the gym much more often. I would love to see a feature where you could add in your one rep max and the app would adjust your workout on that specific exercise around your max, i have seen computer programs that can calculate this and I would give this app five stars if it could as well.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best workout app. Android wear support is amazing!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best gym progression app you'll ever use !  Ive been using this app everyday for several months now and it's really shown how amazing it is. For serious lifters and newbies alike, the app offers hundreds of strength-based and cardio exercises, giving you the ability to easily track sets and reps for progressive overload or any other fitness goal you may have. It also has detailed tracking for units such as dropsets, or you can even add a note with every set (love this feature). Above all however, is the design. I have not come across a fitness app that is this well designed, with beautiful, colourful, yet simplistic designs utilised throughout the app, it makes it a treat to look at.   I recommend purchasing the full version of the app (surprised its not priced more for the value you are receiving) as it unlocked overall tracking of any exercise.  I honestly see myself using this app for years to come, especially since your workout data can be saved and exported to other devices.  Hands down the best app iv'e used for tracking progression in the gym, massive thankyou to the developers !. Get it and make some gains ! :)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,GOOGLE DRIVE SUPPORT!  AWESOME!  You guys totally rock!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Suits my needs. Customizable and easy to use.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Have been using this for over a year now and can easily say this is the best workout tracking app i have use. Thank you for adding Google Drive sync!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Progression keeps saying it stopped responding ever since the new update. Needs fix!!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love this tracker for my work outs. Awesome support too!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Some exercises have diagrams which is nice, but many dont. Also it seem the only option for weight you have is ""kg"" and I use the ""lb"" system.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Terrific support for Wear!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Thanks for the Google Drive integration!   Really impressed by the simplicity and the enormous amount of features. Definitely helps me plan my workouts easily and track them with Google Fit. You've got a hit on your hands! Thanks dev!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I have tried several similar apps and this is the one I kept. I use it together with my Huawei watch. The watch-app interaction is good but there is still some room for improvement. An interactive watch face that gives instant access to various functions related to the current workout would be great. EDIT: The last update with AW improvements earned it the 5th star!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"this apps is suitable for various lifters. simple but nice UI, easy to use. Fit perfectly with my needs. Awesome!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,None other come as close as this.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Was looking for a Stronglifts alternative with total control. Of all the ones I tried this one is the most beautiful, functional and easy to use. What an amazing fitness app!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great material design UI, and easy to use. This is the workout tracking app I've always wanted! 💪",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've tried a few fitness tracker apps, and I have to say this one is my favourite so far.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Anyone who's serious about lifting will know that this app is head and shoulders above the rest. Simple and elegant UI, easy to use and the sync feature is just icing on the cake. If I could request something it would be for a dark theme to be implemented. Having to keep my screen on for an hour or more really saps the battery. Keep up the good work!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"EDIT: recent update is just brilliant. I already loved it, but its even smoother now, especially with my watch. Perfect app! Thanks for listening to the users :)     - UI is the best I've seen. Does what I need it to do. I'm really into using these kinds of apps with Android Wear watches, and this app works perfectly. The developer is keen on further improving the app, which is excellent.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I had an issue with Android wear support not working after the recent update, the developer replied back to my email quickly. He recommended reinstalling the app to force the update on my watch which fixed the issue!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is great! If youre looking for an app to record your workout data, track progress & also provide workouts & individual exercises that can be used to create your own workouts, then I cant recommend Progression highly enough. Backs up onto cloud or device, or both. I have tried so many fitness apps i cant remember most but this one is among the standouts. A Keeper!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Landmine press, mountain climbers, wide grip bench press add theseeee",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Easily one of the best apps for gym tracking on the play store. My only suggestion would be to introduce percentages of rep maxes for a days workout. Intermediate/advanced programs call for changing the weight you lift on certain days based on say 80, 90% 1-5RMs. Being able to say ""Monday is 90% 5RM day, Wed 80%, Fri new 5RM"" would be excellent and means you would only need to change the weight on one day (Fri in that case) to calculate the weights for the rest of the week.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love it. Revolutionized my workout.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best I've tried and I've used several. Easy workflows and the only app I've found where you can easily comment at both an exercise level (eg for tempo) and at a workout/set level.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app and the design is beautiful ! I would love to see Google Drive backup support as well as the Dropbox support. Also removing the sync with Dropbox button in the navigation menu and just have it within settings would be an improved update.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Paid for pro, it was working great until recent update broke syncing with Google Fit and unable to track workout from Moto 360. I would rate it 5 stars and please fix or rollback to previous version.",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Nice and simple to use. Wear app keeps getting better. Clutter free easy workout tracking means I don't get annoyed with tracking when I just want to lift.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Can't ask for more,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The only two ways I think this app could be better is if they expanded their library, and if it could be paired to fitness tracker app like fitbit or UP.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"If you're looking for an app to log serious, consistent weight training, there is nothing better. It has every feature you would expect and more, with a very clean design",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Would be even better if the work out library was larger with even more work outs. I find it is missing alot.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,By far the best fitness app I've ever used and my favorite. I use it to schedule my workouts and keep my workouts organized. Very great app I definitely recommend it,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Helps me a lot... to keep me tracked what am I doing..,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I've been looking for such an app for a while.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I love this app. I have tried a lot of fitness apps over the past couple years and this one has everything that I wanted. User interface is easy. Creating and editing workouts is easy. It has all the exercise descriptions. I feel bad for my friends with apple because they can't get this app. Highly recommend. By far my favorite part is that they have never asked me to rate or review it which is why I'm writing one now. Please keep that going. Thanks!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Update: Still an amazing app! One thing I would still wish for is an export all exercise history to csv feature which shows each exercise entry as a new row with its date, workout ID, duration, name, type/regions of body used, and estimated calories burnt. Please considering implementing this.  Otherwise, keep up the good work!  Old: Great app. Really intuitive to use and stats are a pleasure to view. Developer is very responsive. Of many tried apps is one of the most thoroughly thought out workout apps I have come across.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Simple but customizable.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Just what I was looking for in a workout log app. Allows you to create custom workouts from a large set of exercises with great descriptions, images, and YouTube links.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Will give it a shot in the following month. Hope that would substitute somewhat weird Jefit app I'm using right now.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Hands down the best gym tool I've used - intuitive and stable. Great communication from the dev too. Well worth the donation price.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best app for tracking lifts,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Used to be buggy but now it is perfect. This the best lifting app on the Play Store, period.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is an awesome app that I use every day and it truly betters my workout and fitness tracking experience. It is extremely convenient and makes staying fit fun and easy. It's really fulfilling to see your own progress as time goes on! I only have one complaint: I wish that I could input my height, weight, gender, and age so that I could more accurately keep track of things such as calories burned or weight progress (losses or gains).",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Pros: clean interface, simple to use, rest timer always stays on top of other apps so you know how much time you have until your next set, can build weekly schedule, good built in schedules, can see how much you lifted last time while you're doing your current workout Cons: can't pause workout timer (or at least I haven't figured out how to)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best fitness app I've used, hands down.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Everything I need ... except would be nice to be able to set goals for stuff like 1RM,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Works effortlessly on smw3,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is very helpful where you can dedicate to a particular workout program/schedule. It would be great if the exercise images are available for every exercise, and it  visually reminds the user what to do, instead of reading at the instructions.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Upgraded after a few days. Excellent interface. Plate calculator is a little awkward but nice. Superset function is brilliant. Really like the pre-installed programmes. Are there any plans to have more added during updates or maybe have a community function where users can share their programmes? 10/10.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Would be perfect if I could trigger exercises from my Pebble Watch.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love everything about it :),5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great help with tracking my progress.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Fantastic app!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is Exactly what I was looking for! Easy interface with low rep and high rep and overall just amazing!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It is very quick and easy to input a routine. I also like the fact that you can input different rep schemes. I would like to see the ability to design a workout based on 1 rep maxes and to be able to input different rest times between sets. Still the best workout app I have come across.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Start a workout and follow along with your plan. Love to create my own worlout and add with more information on different exercises. The Workout Analytics are a great part of this app.  Love how to app adapts to your last log and doesn't make you type out every rep and weight.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Exactly what i was looking for. Great job. Only problem is I can't seem to get it working with my Moto 360 smart watch. Is there a compatability issue?,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It's a great app, but now after updating the rest timer doesn't appear on screen. Does anyone know how to make the little circle appear on the screen ?",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It's so perfect, I love the interface, the floating timer head for quick switching back to app and watching time, love the way you can see the bar graphs and watch your growth, love the workout programs included with the app. I've been using diligently for over a month now following the 3 days a week ""simple and super effective"" program. And I am seeing so real results! Thanks for making an app that helps someone who isn't all that bright with physical fitness. Really makes it simple.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Because I want this,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best tracker after SL 5x5,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app with everything you need! Being able to track sets and rest on watch is a fantastic feature. Developer is also very responsive, so that's a bonus.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This should be illegal. Best thing ever for pushing you to be lifting heights.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I really love this App, It's perfect for what I need starting out in weightlifting. Most fitness/training app are all cardio based.  The Material design is very handy and intuitive and it syncs with Google Fit so I can see all my progress in one place. Was happy to pay ;-) Would like it if I could edit my routines online though (read: my laptop)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Simple, yet comprehensive",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Would be nice. Thanks.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This app is NOT for a beginner who doesn't own all this crap. Uninstalled.,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app with a very attractive interface. I particularly liked the android wear implementation, is a feature that definitely sets it apart from the rest and my personal reason for buying the paid version of the app.  My only qualm is that it lacks functionality for repeating exercises on the same day, so is rather incomplete if you are into super sets or repeating sets during the same workout day. I've had to create multiple day workouts just so I can keep track of my daily super sets.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,But I desperately wish it had 'always on' support. Finishing a set then flipping through menus to tick it off is really annoying and I'll probably end up using my phone. So please add always on support for the Wear app.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I really like this app, but I CANNOT figure out the Plate Calculator to save my life. I don't know why there isn't a feature where you can input 45+25+10 and it legitimately calculates how much weight that is (whether for one side or both). It doesn't have to be so confusing. Starting a workout was a little confusing and the rest timer doesn't have to be automatic. Otherwise it's a great app and I like it a lot more than other ones.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"So far this has been a great app for working out. Has a good selection of exercises, pictures to show what a rep should look like, even links in each exercise to YouTube for a more in-depth depiction of the exercise. Works great with my moto360 and seems to be updated regularly. Some things I would like to see  in future updates is a way to log measurements like chest, biceps, legs, waist and such, with a way to remind you to remeasure from time to time, and better description of specific muscles targeted",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Been using this for a month now and it's perfect for me. The pre installed workouts are great for new ideas, workout recording simple and history log easy to check. Great features for a free app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I had been looking for an app just like this for the titular reason, progress! Helps me stay on task and quickly see my progress. Great features especially the rest timer button! Would love to see an iOS version in the future to help my non-android friends!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Clean, wonderful and no nonsense",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Perfect.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Nothing comes close to this app as far as tracking strength training workout sessions. You can set what you want to workout on that day, or choose workouts as you go. It also links to google fit very well. I use moto 360 android wear with it, and I love how I don't even need to take out my phone ever once I start a workout. It also has automatic rest timer so after I finish a set the timer starts automatically and vibrates at the end of rest so that I don't slack off wasting too much time in between sets.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"So close...  Integrates with Google Fit and with Android Watch. Decent set of workouts. Decent set of base exercises with very good explanations. Can add custom exercises and workouts.  BUT - I cannot figure out how to do the same exercise at two different points in a single workout session. Say, for example, I want to start with a light Bench Press, do a few other exercises, and then come back to the Bench Press for heavier sets. The application doesn't provide for this - or it is difficult enough to figure out that it effectively doesn't provide the functionality.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. Had one minor query and the creator was very prompt with a reply. Highly recommend!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I really like how the app looks and works. It has tons of exercises and having everything logged so I remember my weights is great. It's sometimes kinda awkward to create a workout from scratch cuz when you're browsing the exercises the check mark disappears so you end up hitting the back button a few times awkwardly. The biggest bug is that cardio calories seem to be grossly underestimated compared to other apps and cardio machines. Not sure how they're calculated.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Don't really leave many app reviews but I feel this one deserves it. The best workout tracker and planner available, better than all the other alternatives.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app tracks everything I want, love how you can edit the workouts add an exercise and a day, one issue the rest clock has disappeared I now have to scroll down on the top bar bring back the clock.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,All the exercises are arranged in alphabetical order not according to mussels,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Was looking for an app to write my own programme, this app is perfect for it. Completely customisable. A couple of things I'd like to see; I use my bluetooth headphones for music at the gym, at the moment I can't hear the rest time notification, would be good if my music muted whilst this went off. Also, on a couple of days I have 2 workouts, as far as I'm aware at the moment it isn't possible to programme this in. And please add the Rower to cardio! Great app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"As per many users, I've been through numerous workout apps all of which have never been perfect for one reason or another. I'm new to Progression but so far I'm impressed. It gives me all the summary info I'm interested in and a good variety of workouts and exercises. The build your own workout is easy to use. It's integration to Google Fit was the reason I gave this a go.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The app has great exercise explanations and a good selection of workouts. Still can't figure out how to use the scheduler and how to ""start"" workouts, so I'm doing a lot of manual inputs and editing, which is not the kind of time I want to spend during a workout. Not intuitive to my experience.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've gone through 2 workout tracking apps and though they did the job, something was missing. This app has everything!! I love the rest timer and the exercise descriptions! Wonderful app that I strongly recommend!!!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Pros: Integrated into Android Wear, something other majors apps have failed to do. Easy Superset declaration which as well other apps fall short on. Very intuitive Wear navigation with swipe left and right between exercise making it easy to move around in a workout if needed. So far, the best app I've used (hence why I bought pro), considering you can start your workout and unless you're adding an exercise complete it with your watch alone.  Cons: One odd crash which resolved itself. As well would enjoy if you could set the app as ambient/always-visible on android wear instead of it backgrounding when watch sleeps.   A web interface to send data to the app would be awesome as well but for $5 this app has exceeded by expectations (primarily for wear)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love the Google Fit and Android Wear integration. The exercise catalog is also handy. It would be nice if you could also break down exercises by specific muscle area, like rear delt.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great design and pretty intuitive. Good features like rest timer and make your own exercises. Really would like routine to show what I achieved for the previous work out so I know what I'm trying to beat!,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love this app!  Does everything a gym rat would want and more.  It has completely changed the way I keep up with my gym routines and results.  shout out to the developer for creating a very powerful tool.  Only things I wish were different would be to support Samsung Gear and also be able to edit/track body stats (weight, measurements, etc)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Yals progression fitness tracker is awesome,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"No complaints, keep up the good work ! :)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Easy to use, excellent design,google fit integration. The BEST android fitness tracker on the market.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is one of the most impressive apps I have ever seen. The UI is beautiful and silky smooth. Very easy to use and efficient. It is very complete and there is not one detail in your routine that isn't accounted for in this app. Perfect.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Brilliant app.  I've officially run out of excuses to skip leg day now.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app Thank you,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I think I have found my new favorite fitness app. I have been using Bodyspace for a few years now, and it is OK, but it has its own problems.  I decided to start using this one after I found it on Reddit once my old routine was complete. Was interested because of the Wear support (I have a 360), but quickly found that the interface is much nicer (simpler/cleaner, easier to use, etc), and it has more options. The plate calculator is a nice touch, though I feel it is not necessary for dumbbell exercises. I love that the rest timer overlays everything, and syncs with my watch (I am actually starting to wear my watch to the gym because of it). Also, love that the rest timer vibrates when the rest is done - this means less watching my phone between sets, and less guessing. I am actually sticking to my rest times more consistently because of it. Creating my own routine was pretty simple - even when adding supersets. And I like the Google Fit integration.  Though I don't see myself needing the Pro version, I may upgrade just because I like it so much.  All in all, I like this because it works consistently, is there when I need it, and stays out of my way when I don't.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Beautiful and easy to use.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really great app, outstanding interface, good use of the notification area and floating windows. I was really glad to donate. Two minor complaints: 1. apparently it's not possible to add the same exercise twice on the same day (e.g. I like to do a bit of elliptical before starting (warm-up) and after (proper cardio)). 2. I was a bit disappointed by the CSV export feature, as it doesn't export everything, but only a summary of the days. I hope this is extended in the future so that I can truly export *all* my data (every set for every exercise). I think it's really important in order for people not to feel like they're locked in the app. Also: you should set up a website with forum to let people report bugs, suggest features and exchange tips. :) (Update: thanks for the answer! I found the G+ community link at the bottom of the app website. ^^)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The only fitness app I use now.. Thanks.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great App i love it!!! would give 5 but no pounds?? All of my weights are in pounds not kg...,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Any way the data can be synched to my tablet so I can review on larger screen I have the pro version,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Very easy to use and provides support for android wear. Will be supporting the developer. Thanks for your hard work.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Excellent app, best I've used so far. However, would love to be able to add the same work out to a routine more than once, like in two different supersets. Also when making multiple sets in the routine manager, the list of exercises gets too long and cant scroll down to make additional sets.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I  can't tell you how  many times I had no clue how an exercise is supposed to be performed or what it inhaled.  This is alphabetical organized and even has YouTube links.  This alone beats ALL Apps I  have ever installed. .,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app...love it...use it everyday...,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Is it possible to sync with the 5X5 StrongLifts app? If so, I will absolutely go Pro and give you a 5 star rating!!",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"After trying a couple of other apps like this, this one is outstanding. Excellent sync with Android Wear. Start workout on phone then just use watch for recording the workout. Well thought out!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Love this app for lifting, but in creating my own workout I'm having an issue where I can't scroll when adding an exercise to a group. Also, I can't figure out how to use an exercise twice.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Yeah this app is perfect...almost. There seems to be some kind of delay when completing a set on the watch and it showing up on my phone,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is probably the best fitness tracker I've seen so far and the exercises are pretty spot on the only problem is I can't seem to pair it or find the wearable application for my gear s2,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I really like this app but is there anyway to use it my gear s2 can't seem to finds a way to connect them.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Fantastic app and awesome Wear integration.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Works great and the one question I had was answered very quickly by the developer. 8/8 m8,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have used a bunch of exercise apps,  this one is the best so far,  once I got used to the interface,  it's been working like a champ,  interested to see how it works with a smart watch.  Keep up the great work.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Didn't notice anything from the last update which I would have rated 5 star which was perfect but when organising supersets, it will not scroll down to other supersets such as D, E, F.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have tried other exercise apps, but this one is fully featured and works well with my Moto 360 watch. Easy to use, easy to share results.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Took me a minute to understand the UI but after a few minutes of poking around this is one of the best weightlifting apps I've ever used. UI is modern and clean. Google Fit integration is A+. The only knock on this is that i can't figure out how to make the rest countdown audible. would help when my phone is not in my pocket.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Does what is needed with a nice eye-catching look.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,And that masterful material design just makes it that much better and easier to use.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The best app ever, very great job! If you can connect app with google(and some adjustments), app will become perfectly perfect! Shared it on Facebook :)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Awesome,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Overall a good app. Timer skips numbers as it counts down and also believes 80 seconds is a minute and 30 seconds,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Was very out of practice with working out in a gym environment as I hadn't been in about 10 years. After trialling many apps found this one to stand out both from a visual, functional and stability point of view. Well worth the money!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"However, is there any way to add a past workout to the calendar? Sometimes I don't bring my phone to the gym so I can't track with this app, but I'd still like to add it in to see which body parts I've worked. Thanks!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Hows allowed me to keep great statistics on my gym sessions,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is an awesome workout app. It, almost, has everything I need. There should be more specific muscle groups, ie. quads, hamstrings, glutes, instead of just legs. Also, an easier way to export the data, including the entire workout, would be great. I purchased this app so that I could export the CSV, and all it was was a worksheet of the length of time, calories burned, total weight lifted etc. Id like to export the entire workouts, including the exercises, reps, and weights into a worksheet. Then, I can give 5 stars",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It looks like a great app but it was missing a lot of cardio based exercises like jumping jacks and running in place.  Looks great for body building but not for high cardio weight loss.,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The UI is great, and it feels really intuitive to use. However, 2 things, it'd be great if there were a desktop site. Additionally, is there a way to add body weight stats? Currently it calculates calories burned, but of course this cannot be accurate without my weight. 5 stars due when these are implemented! :)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have been looking for an app to track body-weight super-set circuits and this is close, but there is no way to set up something like ""a continuous circuit of 15x mountain climbers, 15x burpees, 15x situps for 5 min"" and track how many full circuits I get through. I can at least visually group them to remind myself what's next, so it's a good start. Adding timing, circuit reps, and better configuration to groups would be a huge step!",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Tried several apps before finding this. Easy to log while working out, pretty intuitive. 2 enhancements to make it perfect:  an option to disable the floating rest timer, and the ability to put notes on an exercise (not just a set). Really like it!  EDIT: Developer is responsive and implemented the changed I'd mentioned. Tried another app in the meantime but have now come back to this one again - other interfaces just can't compare!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app. I've learned new moves, gotten into better shape, and had fun with it, plus it's easy to use and full of features. I'd love some way to back up my history, though: when my phone died I lost that because it was stored locally.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I'm really impressed by the clean, material design.   If you are going for a simple, clean workout tracker, this is the one. Great features, including the ability to add exercises, timers, commenting on sets and build really customized workouts and sets. Absolutely fantastic!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"After syncing to Dropbox, I've lost my current workout :(",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app, this is the perfect way to continue to motivate yourself and strive to improve your body and life, please continue to make more updates for this, I for one will not stop using it by far the best workout app and I've used over 10 lol",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Hands down, the best fitness app available for Android till the date",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Would be great to determine if you've beaten your personal best based on your previous results. There's really no prompt to tell you that you've improved. Other than that this is an excellent workout app,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Easily the best workout app I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot of them. I design mobile games for a living and was pleasantly surprised by this app's attention to detail in UX. Some small quibbles, but nothing major.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The dev is fantastic and is very responsive on G+ and email. Since I first installed Progression it's grown/changed so much, all for the better. This is 100 percent a five star app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Tried a few workout apps like Fitnotes, Jefit, etc. But Progression is the best! Seamless integration with Google Fit and beautiful material design!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It would be great if there is also support for myfitnesspal and runkeeper.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a great app, I love the plate loading calculation feature and the statistics.. And the Google Fit integration is awesome.  It would be nice if I could export a custom built workout schedule (only) and share with a buddy who also uses this app.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really great app, can't believe I wasted so much time with others. Bought the pro upgrade, and the statistics/history is extremely helpful. One suggestion: add stretches!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've been looking for something like this for a while, very clean interface and super customisable - it's great.  Little bit confusing at first in terms of getting circuits set up but once I figured it out it works well.  The only thing I'd like to be able to do is manually start the timer for the next set, rather than it happening automatically as it confuses stats if you don't manage to start your set on time.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app,  thank you! One question, How to change time in stopwatch?",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a great app but it desperately needs more workouts for those who pay for the pro version as well as the ability to back up/sync to google drive not just Dropbox. The feature for syncing with google fit is awesome, thanks!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Has a nice design and seems to have all the features I could ever need (at least in the setup process). Looking forward to testing it out in the gym and buying the unlocker if it is as good as I think it will be.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,برنامه های تمرینی متنوع. تصاویر و متن آموزشی مفید برای هر حرکت. امکان مشاهده ی روند پیشرفت در نسخه پولی.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Has alot to offer,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love this app and bought it to unlock all features. I've been using it since Monday this week and set it up beforehand, and I have to say it's really good. A few notes, though: What is the point of being forced to insert the amount of reps on an all-out (failure) set? And is there an easier way to set up a circuit within a training schedule for a specific day? Asking since I'm doing my ab workouts in circuits and it's a little messy to go back and forth between different exercises and sets. Thanks!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I have tried a few different gym logs this is by far the best I love it's ease of use and reliability due to get a smart watch soon can't wait to try it on that my only slight gripe is I can't see a way to  lower my music volume when the timer sounds which means I need to watch the timer currently smart watch should solve that issue though but great app well done,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Been using this app for the last 2 weeks and love it.  Only missing component would be more tools to analyze my workouts and progress,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,So far for me the only glitch is that I can't seem to edit exercises for a workout after I have completed it. I forgot to add an exercise and I have saved few sets with wrong weight - please make it possible to edit...,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is one of the best fitness apps.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I just started a few different dance aerobic workouts and was disappointed to see dance not listed.,2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best tracker out there and it's worth buying the pro version,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app!!! Great job guys! One thing I'd like to see is integration with my fitness pal :),4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Found this via Reddit and I am over the moon with it. Unfortunately haven't used on my watch as I want to get a silicone band first but have no doubt it will work as effortlessly as the phone app. The summary in particular is fantastic, Well done on all aspects!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Nic,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It helped me to become fitter than I was expecting. This app really helped me.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is the best gym app I've ever used, I no longer need to get my phone out of my pocket as I can track my weight, reps and easily move onto each exercise in my workout from my android wear device. Good work guys, the only wish I have is that you include a rower in the cardio section as I use that to warm up, otherwise an excellent and clean, modern looking app that kicks the snot out of JEFIT (they still have no wear feature). Well done.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I have tried many apps for tracking workouts and this is one of the best. I would give 5 stars but I have a couple questions. Why can't I add multiple of the same exercise to a workout? This is especially useful to me for cardio. And why if I have multiple cardio exercises in a workout can't I change the durations to be different? Say I have treadmill and elliptical in the same workout, if I change the duration of one it automatically changes it on the other. Other than that I like it so far.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Fantastic App - As I normally do slightly different work outs on different days of the week the 'workout now' option is perfect.  One issue I do have, every time I use this app it turns the volume of my alarm to full. Therefore, the next morning I get a bit of a shock when my alarm goes off. I am using a One Plus One.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is a fantastic app that's for sure but I'm just a starter, I need some basic exercises and a schedule to build my body strong. If there is any schedule in this app. That will help me a lot",4

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It gets so many things right, inserting the data is almost a pleasure. With other apps I tried I had to adapt to how they wanted the data input or use workarounds to do what I wanted, with this one it works exactly as I'd like it to. Some improvements: * it should be possible to put the same exercise multiple times in a workout / schedule  * it should be possible to change an exercise of a past workout, or add/remove one.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Relly works...,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I hate it cos all it does is spin in a spiral when it  should be showing the exercise I did,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Will be great to add the option to add additional series for the treadmill running. Sometime you may have mora than 1 serie and the app doesn't let you add the same exercise twice. Thank you and great job!,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Requests unnecessary permissions (access external storage). App should use its private data directory instead.,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I like how this app letting you to customise your own exercise but it would be nicer to add more moves into it and also some warming up move like jumping jacks, burpees, & so on. 😉😉 PS.

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Very well put together and polished app. The developer is responsive, both to questions as well as to the changing hardware/OS environment.

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"My favourite workout app. I've tried several, but this one is the best. I've  been using it every day for several months. If I could add anything to make it even better: include a feature for warm-up sets! And possibly a weight calculator for drop-sets (ie, you punch in set 2 as -10% of set 1, it calculates what that is for you, rounded to the plates you have available. I know it's fairly simple math, but I can't always think straight during a workout). Thanks for the app!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is the best workout tracking app I've used and I've tried a bunch of them.

Looked so much that I was learning to code just to make an app similar to this. ! thanks so much. I'm sure it will come with habit but having to click two different buttons to finish a work out was confusing and I often forget to fully finish the workout.  fantastic app. thanks,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I'm very much enjoying this app. It's simple intuitive and fun to use. The only thing I would suggest for an improvement is the ability to favorite exercises and view progress of those lifts only.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Works great at what it is.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Bought the pro version for $5. Great app, does exactly what I want.  Missing a few obvious features though, like being able to add forearm exercises.  Most everything else seems to be in order.  Definitely recommend it.  *edit* - Within hours of submitting the request for custom forearm exercises, Zoltan replied informing me that they'll be included in the next update.  Awesome dev!  Very happy to support this app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,All the features you want and need in a great material design.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Hi Zoltan, I'm  excited to use this app. However, any reason why the madcow schedule doesn't  include  the ramp up sets? On another note, if I added the ramped up sets manually, does it automatically calculate the sets for the next week's  workout?",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The material design is great! I tried to use another app, but this one has tons of workouts built in and the ability to customize them or create your own from scratch! Keep up the great work!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Would love to see more curated workout routines or an easier way to get routines from the community of users.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best weight lifting app out there. Simple, clean interface and customizable.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the integration with Google fit/drive. Also love the floating rest counter.-- downgraded to 3 Android wear part is not working on moto360 2nd gen,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really nice Material interface, well designed, and tons of functionality even for a free app. It's very flexible and customizable and does a great job letting you build new exercises and routines. Also has nice animated diagrams for a lot of exercises which makes it look a lot more polished than apps that just embed a crappy YouTube video.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The best app for tracking your lifting progress! Clean UI, powerful analytic functions and an awesome developer who takes his time to answer questions!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is great!  I honestly believe the website when it says it's ""made by weightlifters for weightlifters"".  The developer has really put some time and effort into the design and thought behind this.  Love the extra little details such as being able to comment on every set or denote a set as a warm-up or drop set, all done intuitively with ease.  My only niggle would be to add Google Drive support and other cloud storage, recently wiped my phone to upgrade software and lost my previous work-out details (i'm not a drop-box user)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"... If the creators have a cardio progression option for treadmills, cross trainers, rowing machines etc! Then the app would be complete!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app. Detailed enough for my used but has enough space to grow. One thing I bought the pro version for was the smart watch integration. But it doesn't seem to work. Any suggestions?,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Clean, simple and very helpful. The problem with so many of these apps is they quickly become bloated and over designed. This app includes everything I need and is intuitive.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is a very good app especially if you don't know how to use all the equipment in the gym. I really like that it's very structured and can help somebody start a workout program and keep with it. Also like that there are youtube links to the workouts you don't necessarily know how to do so you can see someone doing them. This app is far more worth paying $180 a month for personal trainers who  are not very helpful.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Really pretty and useful app to make your own workout plan or even follow an existing schedule. I tried 5 other apps just before this one, but none of them were able to do what I wanted and none of them looked as beautiful as this one. I ran into 1 small bug so far when the app crashes when I try to add an exercise to a group, happens once a while. Big thumbs up for no ads, paid for the pro nerveless to support the developer, cheers!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Been keeping me on track. Simple to use, adding workouts and making a schedule is easy. Does occasionally crash when making a workout plan. Would love the following features: crash reporting, back up to Google drive, ability to add your own pictures to custom made exercises.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really great UI design and awesome statistical information from your workouts. Great app!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Perfect lifting app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Was wondering though, do you plan on adapting for Android Wear at all? With the 360 sport coming out soon, that could be useful.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Nice app. However, I wish I can create a circuit training workout. I see I can't add the same exercise twice to a workout. Any plans to add this? Thanks.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The only issue I have is that you can't get rid of the rest timer bubble,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great clean design, app functions well and I appreciate the integration with Google fit.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I really like this app for tracking weight and reps for a workout. I would love to see auto weight-increasing increments for each exercise the way stronglifts app does it. You should check out that app and see if there is a way to implement some of those features into this app.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Very nice Android Wear Integration. Would be nice to keep my watch screen on so i don`t have to wake it up after every set. Idea... how about you say what weight your going to do in a set and the watch tracks the reps using the motion sensor...,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is one slick app, exactly what I was after and it really pushes you! I was fed up with using bits of paper/Google keep and a stopwatch, this app says goodbye to all that and more! Good variety of different built in workouts, and excellent material design All my iOS friends are jealous of this, love it!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Fantastic app. The calorie estimations for workouts seem low though, and woud like to see integration with my fitness pal. Already integrates with google fit which is fantastic. Super fast and easy to track workouts and make programs. Way more customizable than other apps I've tried. My favourite workout tracker by far.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This is an amazing app. It really is. It does everything you want from a progression app. Love te detail and highly reccommend paying for the pro version aswell. It's that good. Absolutely love this app.EDIT 2. Using this app now for a month. It has got to the point where I will delay my training session to charge my phone just so I can get everything noted. Something so easy such as the timer has improved my lifting. If you're new or experienced to weightlifting, get this app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Fantastic app. Clean and easy to use design. Makes it easy to progress and track your workouts.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've been using this app for about half a year being fairly content, and today, all my data was just gone. No custom workouts no history, nothing. I'll be switching to another app.",1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Pretty neat app,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best tracking app I have used, period. The only thing that could make it better is a web based UI for better access.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is simply fantastic. Felt great creating my own routine. The fact that there were no ads to make my blood boil - yes, I hate ads with the greatest of passion - convinced me to buy this app after two days of use.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The app looks fantastic and is easy to use, it took about 15 minutes to get everything set up from scratch for a 4 day split.  Dropbox and Google fit integration is definitely cool too. So far my only request would be a dark them option.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,and how badass a name is ZOLTAN??? Sounds like some powerful wizard dude made this.   The best workout app keeps getting better.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great rep n set tracker,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've downloaded 4 different fitness apps today and this one is by far my favorite. The simplicity of it is amazing. It's very easy to use and has exactly what I need to record a workout. It doesn't add in useless tools like some other apps do. All I needed was a way to add workouts to an A, B, C type of groups and this app does that. I left the app to do this review and noticed the rest timer stays embedded where ever I go on my phone! Love it! Edit: I liked it so much I just paid for it. Support the dev!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Only thing missing (I think ) is the ability to put two week plans in. Otherwise this is an excellent, intuitive app.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Please use this app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Definately the best. Does everything I need.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Absolutely love the app. Once you get your programme inputted, it remembers your last weight, gives you a rest timer, and keeps statistics of your progression (pro version). It's really changed the way I work out.  Small note: it seems like there's a bug. When it's time to go up in weight, I'll enter it in as I'm waiting for the timer to count down. If my phone goes screen lock, then the counter finishes, when I open the app back up it's forgotten the previously higher weight.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,So easy to use.  Stats are very in depth,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The developer tends to update at a bit of a better pace than other apps workout apps I've tried,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is exactly what I was looking for, however I need to be able to record previous workouts, as I have loads of logs relevant to my current schedule and I cannot see a way to do that. Without a feature like this it is really difficult to transition into this app. Am I missing something?",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love being able to always know what I did last time, and if I am improving. It's also nice to find some exercises that are different so I don't get bored doing the same stuff. Still some room for improvement, but I am sure it will come with time. Thank you for this app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,It would be great if you could add a google fit backward integration - when I'm running or cycling to add the stats to the progression app? Also is there an easy way to input my stats AFTER the training? I don't like to input them during one. Also there is no possibility to end or delete a current workout,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Awesome,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Works great, no complaints.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Good app. Doesn't crash, easy to understand and use. Very simple but detailed app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Want to reorder the routines during workout.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I don't know what I'd do without it! My daily driver. Recent updates have cleared  mostly if not all noticeable bugs with great features added on too. Keep it up!!!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Honestly, this is the best workout log I could find. Not only that,  it sets the bar high for any other app to follow. I was getting pretty tired of lugging my paper log around the gym. Since I always have my phone on my person, due to music, I figured I'd dive into the realm of a logging app. This thing sets the standard. Meat head and fitness freaks alike. Use this app. This thing is gonna help launch me into the 1000 club.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Okay, first off, I LOVE THIS APP!!! It's easily the best one I've EVER used. However, what made me write this is how it's glitching and forcing me to re-enter an entire day's workout of 5 or 6 supersets with specific guidelines that I had to enter myself. After entering all my stuff, I'll press save and then it'll go back to the weekly workout I just deleted. Everything I'd done was gone. I've had to do this at least 4 times times. I'm sure it'll work eventually but please fix this!!!",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Needs a standalone android wear application, so when I say, ""Start A Workout"", the workout of the day will begin. Also I don't want to have to carry around my huge phone while working out.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great app! Includes pretty much everything I want in a fitness app. One thing, however, if you could add a way to add the same exercise more than once to a workout set that would be awesome. For example, I do exercise A, the B, then A, then C, but currently there is no way to add in the second A. Just a suggestion!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've completed 2 workouts from the preloaded schedule and they have been solid and challenging. Great integrations of Google fit and YouTube. I like the ease at which I can add my own exercises to preloaded schedules, workouts, and schedules.  I would love to see the addition of cardio machines like stairmaster, treadmill, elliptical ect. I am definitely considering upgrading to the pro version...and I NEVER pay for apps!!!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I'm so glad I found this app it helps me so much to stay on track when I workout and get the most out of it! Besides not being very good at recording time based or the fact it doesn't record cardio excersises, it does strength excersise just perfectly. Plus with the pro you can see your progress and track yourself. So happy!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app. Was wondering if there are plans to integrate with fitness trackers (I own a fitbit) and if there are plans to develop a way to track interval training?,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Google Fit integration is icing on the cake of this wonderful Material app. Best $6 I ever spent on my health. Put the Starbucks down people and pick this up! The only thing keeping this from being a 5 ★ app is that there's no way to add instructional artwork and the app theme isn't modifiable with a personal profile with avatar etc,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Liked it!,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Gorgeous,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Beautiful and easy to use.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Absolutely amazing app. Clean design, fast and easy to use. Great features like auto load sets, auto rest timer and even a plate calculator. Author provides great support and active development.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Best in class!  This app creator 'gets it' when it comes to working out in a gym.  And, he was able to apply that in an incredible app.  And it works BEAUTIFULLY on my smart watch!! It is elegantly simple. I am using it and maybe some day I will read the instructions.   I love the workout creation flow,  superset setup (see new version), exercise stats, and how it flows seamlessly on my smart watch during my workout. So many other pluses!  If you workout in a gym and have a smart device, get this puppy. You will not regret it. Nice job!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Not fir me,1
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I downloaded literally dozens of apps before I stumbled upon this one. Its excellence lies in its simplicity: there's no required sign up, massive list of exercises, and ability to create exercises quickly. This is an excellent app for experienced lifters who need something to write workouts down for a reference, instead of relying on it for the whole workout. I think this is the only app that allows you to easily create supersets. Simply amazing, keep up the good work!!!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Simple, User-friendly, no operational pRroblems",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Most feature-full and nicest looking lifting tracker that I've seen yet. Love the large exercise database with pictures and quick links to search for YouTube videos.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app however your 1MR calculations are a bit off. I can rep 205 6 times but I sure as heck can't max out at 550.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Featuring tons of exercises, great tracking and analysis capability and even Android Wear integration at an acceptable price, Progression is by far the best of its kind.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Good for a no frills experience. Wish it integrated with fitbit,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Good,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Fantastic app! I would add a HIIT workout, would make it perfect! However I can't seem to be able to buy pro version, screen gets dimmed but nothing appears...",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Beautiful, easy to use, although very detailed app.  Zoltan, please add ability to add user images (or even videos) to notes, that would help a lot )",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Tried a bunch. This is the all around best one. Stronglifts is amazing but its only for its own routine. This is almost as great and you can choose from many different routines and create your own. Very intuitive and feature-filled. The only request I have at this point is to have a way to add and automatically calculate warm up sets.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"My only problem is that there doesn't seem to be a way to add past workouts, would be nice to migrate all my old data to have graphs all in one place. Also would like to see an option to export data as .CSV for backup and to load into excel. This would make it a 5 star app for me but still good.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I really love this, more a question than a comment. Will you be adding more schedules or will just be what is there and what ever the user makes themselves?  I got my friend on this app today and straight away he was a fan he pointed out thou you don't have the likes or bikes treadmill, cross trainer ect in the excise area I hadn't noticed being I put my cardio in the comments, will you be adding them out of curiosity? Thanks again 5star app.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Zoltan Demant, it took like an hour to download and I had good Internet connection...Now I just have to try it out.",3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Very easy and smooth interface...some muscles are missing though. But it is really helpful.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I love this app. As a complete novice the built in workouts are great, the exercise descriptions and youtube integration are superb. The Android Wear functionally is so helpful and makes usage a breeze.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Easy to use and clean, snappy interface. Very intuitive. Would like to 1) be able to write a multi-line comment on my workouts 2) more exercises and pictures 3) a better exercise search function which enables searching for multiple separate words (in any order)",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Amazing app!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Perfect app to track your workouts, whether you make them yourself or download them",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I used to think that Materials Design was pretty, but didn't really make the most of the screen space. Then I tried using other fitness apps during an intense workout and now I'm convinced. This app is so simple and easy to use. I bought Pro even though I won't use the Dropbox syncing to support the Dev. Few suggestions:  -Any plans to sync with Google Fit? It'd be nice if all my health stats were viewable in one place. Of course, Google Fit isn't exactly the most full-featured fitness displayer so might not be worthwhile.   -Maybe add a FAB for adding a new exercise to a workout instead of having to scrolling to the bottom?   -The large number of variations of exercises is great for being able to put in exactly what you're doing, but somewhat unwieldy. For example, the million variations of curls (seated, hammer, bar etc). Also, weird that you have Shoulder Press, but not Seated Shoulder Press when you do have Seated Arnold Press separate from Arnold Press. Did you just scrape a database? Maybe having a ""base"" exercise with tags that you can set for variants would be better?  -I couldn't find Rear Dumbell Deltoid Flys but I guess Seated Bent Over Raises are the same thing.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Finally, an app that does what it's supposed to and has Android Wear support! The only other thing I can think of I would like to see is more cloud support, for OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It just runs so well! The design is absolutely superb and the amount of effort that I can tell went into it is astounding (and it has freaking Wear support! aaaaahhhh!). Probably the most impressive app I've used in a long time, and that's saying something.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Simple and easy to use,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Perfect app for strength training. Lots of thoughtful features. Clean and intuitive UI with great use of material design principles. Would love future versions to sync with myfitnesspal and Google Fit, and also an option to use Google account sync vs Dropbox.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Great design. Easy to use. However I cannot select a schedule. After selecting a schedule, random one appears as my schedule.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Like importing workouts to s health app? On galaxy s6,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Fantastic app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Some muscle groups are missing that would be nice to add. otherwise i love the app! I also wish the PHUL and PHAT programs were listed in the pre made routines.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I rarely write reviews except when something as good as this comes along. Great design with plenty of exercises to choose from. The ability to add a workout to your calendar helps a lot.The ability to create custom exercises with their own sets and rep ranges is great, as well as the ability to create supersets and custom groups of exercises. My only problem with this is I see no way to save a group to be used again on another day.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Used you once and it just works!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great it works with android wear. Great material design. Would like to see body weight tracking added to see progress and a more accurate calories burned result,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Just bought the pro version. I'll give it 5 stars if it has feature to compare each workout session.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Well thought out layout and consideration for super sets. Rep range also amazing interface being able to do three day split and rearrange the order workouts.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love it,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I've used Jefit, the SL app, fitnotes and Progression is hands down the easiest to use, and cleanest design. Love this app and the dev is great with updates. Bought the paid version to support!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Finally done with notebooks and spreadsheets. Love the app, gonna buy the pro version and I don't even know what it does. Would love to have automatic weight added each workout and goal setting (ie I want to sqaut 250 by July 1st)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"For a long time I wanted to write something similar for gym tracking. It seems to me that Zoltan read my mind and did all even better than I could have imagined. One thing: maybe, gdrive sync? :) PS. Finally, I can get rid of the trashy Jefit!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Nicely done.  My only problem is that somehow exercises disappered from my working plan but i dont know how to reproduce :-/,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Haven't been using these trackers long but this has all I want or could need. Great app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This app works just like stronglifts. Tells you how much to lift and when and how much to rest and you can customize it fully. This deserves to be way more popular! Great work guys!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"After trying several fitness tracker apps I have to say, from my personal experience, this is the best fitness tracker app I've ever used and I use it in every training now! Really good job, incredibly well done app, with a lot of useful information and stats, and I've recommended it to more people. This was exactly what I've been looking for a long time. Keep up with the great work!",5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"This app is just incredible, I will pay for it but my I can't use my Card and I don't know why. Please add more Workout Schedules I love the built in but more will be just incredible. Especially Heroes like Batman, Captain America and others.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Looks very professional. One thing I would like is to have different reps for each set. For example I want to do 15, 12, 10, 8, 8 reps but the app only allows to have min and max. The pyramid reps is important in certain workouts.",4

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I like the app, but would like animation for the exercises. Thank you. Just a suggestion.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best app on the Play Store for lifting. Just a feature suggestion if you could have Pebble integration as you do with Android wear that would be awesome! Even without it 10/10!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Does what it says real well and the design of the app looks fantastic. It could use some improvements here and there, like syncing with Google fit and beeping when the rest timer ends, or being able to sync with Google drive instead of Dropbox. Over all though the best fitness app I've used so far.",5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I bought this just to support the dev -- I don't even really care about the extra features.

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,The most comprehensive and customizable workout app. A must for any serious lifter or bodybuilder. Keeps track of everything.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Crashes when I delete an event,3
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Start a program, they have a good selection to get you started. What sold me. They have a good old school heavy weight body building program I used back in the day. You can modify them, according to what kind of equipment you have, SMART! A feature that gets left out in others I've tried.",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Seriously - and a gorgeous design to kick. I especially love the rest timer. Forces you to get through your workout in a timely manner and do it right,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"""Zoltan""the developer, is the best when it comes to support & fixing bugs, as he responds quickly & tries his best to fix the app issues ASAP. For the app itself, up till now it's the best in the market without a doubt. Am in love with the history stats & fascinated with the statistics (update to pro to use it) & now with the ""Resume"" update, the app became even more flexible than it used to be. Thanks a ton ""Zoltan"" for this generous little  app!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Has what I need, but I would prefer drive integration. Still it's my favorite workout app available.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I like everything about the app. It would just be cool if I could create active rest days and write down what to do on those days in a way different than simply writing in the notes for that day. It would also be cool to set up different resting times after certain exercises because not all exercises have the same rest times. Just a few suggestions.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is a must have app for anyone who goes to the gym. It's perfect for keeping track of your different workout and custom exercises.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Works great, looks great!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Loving the design. Only waiting for exercise pictures now and will buy :),5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Sweet UI,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Best tracker out there!! Needs Google Drive sync to be a 5 star app! (My personal preference over drop box),4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Simple, sleek, works very well.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Very intuitive, very motivating and a wide selection of pre made workouts or you can quickly and easily make your own",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Am I misunderstsnding?  Not interested,  if only barbells squats...",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Very easy to use while working out, and a great set of features.  Keeps track of your previous reps/weight PER SET,  not just the last set like most other apps.  Dev is quick to respond & has some great features lined up for future release (e.g., more advanced chart analysis. 1RM, total volume, total reps, etc.)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Needs cardio exercises,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,This is one of the best exercise related apps that I have used. It's incredibly intuitive and easy to use. I cannot recommend this app highly enough. I would be hard pressed to believe that there is a better app out there for weightlifters.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Well constructed and simple. Great job Dev used it for the first time yesterday and it was so easy to navigate and take notes on my workouts. Thanks for the great app!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Really loving this app but...,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Well thought out app that has been perfectly executed. The attention to detail is excellent, everything from the app icon to the in app icons, the colours used and font makes the new Material design UI stand out from the rest, and i've used alot of fitness apps. The UX is information rich, and if you don't understand a workout or how part of the app functions, there's an explanation provided to guide you along. Definitely would recommend as this app has given me the motivation i needed, even just opening it to see the awesome UI. Plus the dev is awesome aswell! Fingers crossed for future wearable support =D",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,gooooood,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Wonderful interface, easy and fun to use.  I would recommend this app",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"So far so good. Got 4 stars because I can't seem to find the create your own exercise option, is it only for the pro version? Other than that. LOVE IT! Great job",4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"It is OK to track, but doesn't give you a way to see your previous weights and reps while working out without clicking backwards and forwards",2
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Love the app. It looks great and works really well. I had a problem with past workouts being deleted and the developer worked with me to find the issue. My only complaint  now is the icon looks a little dated on Android,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Can we get an option to log workouts after we have done them? I'm sure that many people would want it.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great ui and a solid set of features. It just works. Even the adds are tolerable but the upgrade is worth it on such a well put together app.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great looking app and works well for seasoned veterans. Would like to see images for exercises to remind you of how it is performed.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great workout companion.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Cool app,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I want to like this app but since last update it will not allow you to edit your sets and save them. When you make a change it changes all sets to whatever you did on your first set. Even if you delete the exercise and try again it reverts back to to the previous problem.,4
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Loving the style but I would like to see it with Drop Down(super sets) & Rest-Pause sets options and when adding eg. Treadmill you choose timer but always goto add reps ?  Apart from that awesome app keep up the great work and looking forward to seeing updates. :-) Edit: Super Sets I mean not drop down, it's been one of those days.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Nice app! I love it! The only one request - can you provide a visual excesise comics which explains how to do it right? That will increase the usabilyt to a new level!  Thanks,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"The design and UI of this app has been incredibly executed.  Not only is it beautiful to use, all the functionality is there that we need in the gym and ease of use I cannot rate highly enough.  The developer is very responsive and really looking forward to the enhancements that are planned.  I've used all the apps of this type and my search is now over!",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Using this app makes the gym much more of a pleasure and less of a chore. It's the perfect tool to have in the gym with you and not have to record anything after or remember numbers. The app is beautifully designed and the pre-programmed Workout Schedules are perfect for beginners that need a starting place. The developer is also very quick to respond to feedback and release features and updates. 5 Stars.,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Well, I'm stumped. Such a fluid, well equipped workout log that should be used by everyone. Definitely recommend.",5

workout.progression.lite,A Google user,good,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,Great app!!!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,I workout at home using only a set of dumbbells and this app still gave me a great training experience. Huge plus for not having intrusive ads (Ads that are added as shortcuts on your phone etc.) like all other free fitness apps!,5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I think this app will be so useful and interesting for those who really need to be organized with their scheduling for their training. hopefully I'll be less lazy and soon start with gym to try this good looking, interesting app ;)",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"Awesome app in my opinion. Been wanting this for an long time, others which do the same thing are way to complex for something that should be simple. The complex ones take so long in gym to sort that just end up leaving it. This is quick and easy.",5
workout.progression.lite,A Google user,"I personally do not exercise regularly, but I downloaded this app just to see how it is organized and so on. I can tell that the layout is professional even in the free version of it, so I enjoyed only browsing it. It gets a 5 from me, as an occasional user.",5
