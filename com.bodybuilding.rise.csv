com.bodybuilding.rise,Maurice Kane,Extremely unreliable. App frequently crashes and workouts not recorded,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Kotte Eswaran,I have charged for yearly subscription but after 1 week usage the subscription has been cancelled but the amount has been and not yet refunded to my account. One of the worst app . I need my money back or provide proper conclusion.,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,FourBlix Test,Gd,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Berry Void,"The work that's put into it is grueling, but in the end I know the results will be great! Coaches are awesome and really make the workout enjoyable. It's been hard for me to find a good workout routine and I'm glad this app works so well. (Though the videos usually show an error mid workout which is kind of annoying but other wise perfect!)",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Victor Artyomenko,Some of the meals are off on calories some by like 150 cals and carbs Duty otherwise it's good.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Kirk Carpenter,"Enjoy the app. Great workout options, good tracking, good descriptions of exercises. The built-in in timer is my only real complaint. It doesn't always give the notification right away and doesn't override music. So, if you aren't staring at your phone, you might not notice your rest period is complete.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jason Carrier,Love how it keeps you not guess what your next workout is,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Rory,So many workout to choose from. I especially like that they have one day workouts in case you don't want to commit to one specific program yet. I did follow a month long workout schedule and didn't like that I had to go back to weeks 1-2 to view the same videos I had to follow for later weeks.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Carlos Silva,The new update fixed the annoying bug of force closing the app everytime my phone turned off the screen. I dont rate 5 stars just because u cant add exercises to the workouts...or i haven't found a way to do it. Other than that i love it.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Q,"I travel often so having the same set of equipment always available isn't an option. Bodyfit does not meet that goal. Even body weight workouts that state ""no equipment"" still end up needing a pull up bar and tension bands. If you can't offer an equipment free workout dont label it as such. Its deceptive and I'm stuck trying to figure out subsitutes because the app only gives vague alternatives in the discription with no demonstration of alternative motions.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,David Hradsky,Great to get back to basics that build the foundation of your body.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Tracie Maganas,Great experience,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Abraham Bhagat,Good and easy to follow app.... Love the Dorian Yates workout,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Donald Bunce,Only way I step into a gym.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Rosario Moreno,"Great for all levels of fitness. Lots of detailed information. Nutrition, supplements, meal planning. Videos that show you how to perform each move. Some programs even have Playlists to workout to.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,C J,Would be great if we can get a golden era routine,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Hector Viramontes,Good workouts but stale not updated Rest timer is inaccurate. For example i set a timer of 1 minute in between sets it may go off after 5 minutes or sometime not at all.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Abner Benavides,💪💪💪💪💪💪💪,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,David Tomaszycki,"App overall is good. It doesn't allow for tracking your weight used during supersets which is annoying but can deal with it. HOWEVER, the newest update has a rest timer which beeps the last five seconds before the time is up. It overrides the music I am listening too and shuts the music off. Extremely annoying and enough to cause me to cancel the app. EDIT-problem solved 48 hours later. App is pretty perfect. Has everything you could need",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Khashayar Roshani,The timer that is added to the new update pause my music. Its so fraustrating that my music stop after each set. Please fix it,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Travis Bolton,"A great fitness app. There has been some weirdness with how they handle timer notifications (currently no audible notification so you have to watch the timers), but aside from that it works great.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Evan Werley,"2nd Review Update: Why keep releasing new versions with updates instead of fixing all the crashing issues in all these reviews?! I still cannot cast to my TV without crashing the app. This has been a prevalent issue since the 3.1.2 release, and I have attempted to contact the app for support. Would rate 5 stars if I could go back to version 3.1.1 that actually work properly...",1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jason Harris,They fixed the issue with the app crashing when the timer is going. They did update it and now it beeps for the last 3 seconds. It's kind of annoying. It shuts my music off and there is no way that you can shut off the beep.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Omari Thomas,I thought I was fit this is proving otherwise,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Clint Kenn,"Seems good, be cool to get a few sports specific training programs on the site.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Rob Tag,Itk ok. I don't like it when the timer sound pauses music,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Marcus Olivas,Great app all around great workouts and helps you stay motivated and focus on your goals,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,William Smith,Just want in needed to get me out of the same old routine,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,alan segat,Timer cuts off my music !!! It's so frustrating. How hard it is for the timer alert to sound over the music instead of pause it !!!! Please fix this !!!,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Alex Dreyfuss,Excellent app. Been using it for 2 years to track and keep myself interested. I have 3 main concerns at this point: I'm using an S21+ Recent update broke a lot of the interface because the default font on Android changed and now there is overflow text. As far as accessibility is concerned. I just wish there was a was to log on pull-ups when you needed assistance and how much. Seems like the one area where ability is not accounted for. I really wish there was a watch app to enter and track.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jess Borgos,"Helps track your workouts, lots of variation for people of any workout regiment just have to put the work to find it",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Salini Don Don,"This app is great. However, what I would really like is the ability to track the progression of weight lifted for each exercise. If we were to make that change, it would definitely be a 5 star product for me.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jesse Olivarez,5/5,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Joe Schwehr,"Recent issues have made this app a lot worse than it used to be. I've used this app for years but a few months ago started having problems. There were days when you couldn't log in at all. Unusable. Then there was a bug when switching to a different app during workouts. And the bodybuilding app would lose track of what exercise you are. And you have to start all over. Now they have tones indicating the rest period has ended, but this stops my music EVERY SET. STOP BREAKING YOUR APP!!!!!!!",1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Brad Kaufman,The app now pauses my Amazon music when the workout timer goes off. Please fix.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Nikki,"Installed originally 3 years ago, then switched to a different program. Just re-installed and it's way better, loving it!",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Everett Sowash,Just started a great app to use very simple and easy too follow,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Cris Santos,Need more updated exercises,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Felipe Socheuk,"It's a great app, however I can't login anymore, sent an email regarding this isse but got no answer. When I login into my account on the app, it says Subscription on Hold, but when I go to the Play Store there's nothing there. I had cancelled the subscription about a year ago and now I can't use it. Can't even buy another plan, it gives me Transaction Declined. Edit: Impressive how I still can't login, getting these errors, and bought other stuff in another app and went OK.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Joshua Noriega,Explosive,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Rusty Davis,"It would be a 5 star but it lacks a lot of useful tools that limit it from its full potential. At $6.99 a month its 3 star, but at $9.99 there is a lot to be desired. For the workout plans that cut or bulk it would be awesome to have a way of tracking macros/calories on each day of the plan so you could have all the tools you need in one app.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Billy Clayton,The workouts are well worth it. It's clear defined exercises with video examples. Almost done with my first basic 12 wk workout and looking forward to moving up to a more advanced course.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Scott Beaudin,"Videos often cut out, and I wish I could make better personal notes, but you get a lot of workouts and there's enough to keep you active for a long time. EDIT: Minus 1 star because the app is incessantly asking me to rate it, even though I already have. Also, if I go into another app (check socials in between sets, for example) the app has to reboot when I go back to it and I lose my timers, etc.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Knobbe family1,Great app,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,S Martinez,"Letters and numbers are missing in every article making it difficult to read the articles within the app. Originally, it worked very well but I'm downgrading the rating to a 3 star, it would be a 5 star otherwise.",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Michael Wall,Educational,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Gatis Praude,Great app! Never had any issues 👌,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jeff Zavatsky,Worth it,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Ambitious Coruscating,Great app,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jason Wright,Was such a good app until I had to start paying to even use it😔,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Nathan Hansen,Great app. Useful timers and exercise how-to's. Big complaint is that the history feature doesn't work for most supersets or exercises that involve switching sides (e.g. single arm or leg). I've also seen the history get lost or transfer to another similar exercise (when I've never done the new exercise before).,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Blake Howard,"App was working perfectly before this last update. Now when I go into the track exercise or into a workout the weights and sets do not properly show and half of the words/information is cut off. Tech support stated the problem is fixed, yet it is not fixed as of 2/22/23",1
com.bodybuilding.rise,DIMO STACKS,Useful app minus the expensive subscription,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Lennon Stonebraker,Gethin is a beast. Great programming.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Teddy R.,Would be better if it isn't close itself when switching to other app sometimes,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Athena Robichaud,Lots of options for beginners and intermediate. Don't know about expert cuz I'm not one 😆,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Erasmo Vela IV,"Crashes from time to time, needs more workout programs for No Equipment/limited equipment. Add option to hear workout without the music. Show what weight the instructor is using for a baseline to start from.",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Lennon Crow,Great weight lifting app,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Brandon Banton,APP was working fine after update in January but now February update tells me I have to update my payment and I was paying 2 separate payment for the same app,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Maria Burce,"Over the course of many years this app has helped me get in shape. It's easy to follow. And it spares me the anxiety of not knowing what weights to pick up to train. I especially like that I can go in and out of the gym in a timely matter, if I stick to the plan. It's like having your own personal trainer. Thank you Lee Labrada!!",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Tim Henderson,Too expensive. Was great for $5.99 then the rate went up. I contacted support asking if they could honor the rare I had because they also stopped carrying my protein brand and products have been starting to drop off. Response I got was instructions to cancel.,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Hiten Joshi,The app is good except after the recent update it crashes on connecting with wifi,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A. Williams-McCray (DK),Great but glitches,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Andrew DeLacy,Loses info and wont load properly for months at a time. Raised price by 40$ before i could cancel reoccuring charge,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Ambre Gejer,I'm not a fan of the functionality of the workout tracking function. Only the first set has a rest timer built in. Reviewing the movement technique videos is also not possible while in the tracking function.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Penny Luke,"Especially love Hanna Eden. The app does glitch every so often, but I persevere.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Ward Melenich,There should be a timer for between exercises. It just has a rest timer between sets. A sound to let you know when the timer is up would be great.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Tim Schoonover,"Overall I like the format and functionality. I wish that they would develop the sets a bit more. Often they will ask you to do drop sets but the app doesn't handle that. If a piece of equipment isn't availy, it won't let you replace with something similar, which their free version does.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Martha Bejarano,Programs are awesome. The constant restarting during workouts is annoying AF.,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,G Linares,Detailed and organized,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Fabian Torres,App keeps closing when rest timer is active and I switch to a different app (i.e. text or music app) and switch back. Been doing this since everyone was kicked off app and wouldn't log anyone back in,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,K Castaneda,First time a video workout keeps my attention for more than 2-3 days and keeps me looking forward to the next day! Very excited I found this app.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,David D Riley,Liv3 it,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,matt gould,It's OK. I don't like how it tracks your workout progress sometimes and don't others! How am I suppose to make progress when it doesn't keep track of my reps or weight the next time I do the same routine? I've been doing Blue print to mass and on my chest/ back next routine it's a blank page I gotta fill from scratch.. That's butt bro.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Elliot Mitchell,They've fixed the app quickly and it's my go to every day. Great stuff,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jamie Manning,I love the app definitely helps me reach my goals and has great routines. But it has a lot of server issues sometimes its down for days.,4

com.bodybuilding.rise,Robert Webster,App not letting me sign in,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Vincent Manieri,"Horrible. This app used to be awesome, but now it crashes every time I navigate to another app. When I reenter Body Fit, it crashes every time. PLEASE FIX Edit 1/16: The new update fixed it. Reinstalled and the problem doesn't happen anymore. Stars have been changed. Thanks!",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Corey Wills,Helped me break through my bench press plateau I had been struggling with for years.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Fady Erian,"Edit: Now that the issue is resolved, the app is working perfectly fine. It was amazing until it stopped working. Between sets, if the phone is not showing the app and opened, the app will turn off on its own. And sometimes it will lose your whole training done during the day. That needs to be fixed or I might be looking for another app.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jose Manuel,5/5 update did not work. Still crashes. + can we please see the history of super sets? 4/4 can we please please please Edit super sets 3/3 error saving workout again on a different program.

com.bodybuilding.rise,Ryan R,Devs often take weeks to fix major bugs.,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Crist Cuffee,The app currently crashes a lot and if I exit it I have to restart the app and then continue my workout. The app has great routines at a great price but the interface needs a lot of work for the actual tracking portion. I give it 3 out of 5 for that reason. If this is updated I would gladly write a new review.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Anthony Washington,Great app,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,robert fontenot,The app keeps abruptly closing,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Teva Gallet,Ah used to be kinda glitchy and now it constantly crashes when I lock my phone.. I've figured a way around it (sometimes) that it only seems to crash most of the time when I lock my phone during the rest time countdown. If you cancel the countdown then it won't crash...as often...... hope this helps everyone else experiencing this issue. Hope the fix it soon!,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,powa777,"Good app but lot of glinches, in my case, once im browsing other apps and then back to the bodyFit app, all my progress reset. I followed the troubleshooting, uninstalled re-installed change passwprd. I still have the same issue..😢😢😢",3

com.bodybuilding.rise,Bill McCune,"Since the last update the app crashes entirely any time my phone screen times out and goes dark. UPDATE: Tech support was quick to build an update that corrected the problem, now fully functional and the best gym app out there for building lifting routines and tracking your progress.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Gary Thomson,"I've been using this app since 2017, I think that speaks for itself.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,John Brown Jr.,It works pretty well. I wish the cardio timer was unlimited. It only allows you to add 60 minutes for some reason.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,This Guy,Love this app. But this app crashing repeatedly is the most annoying thing in the world. You guys need to send out a hot fix ASAP. This is ridiculous. Update: you guys fixed the app before my next workout so I couldn't be happier. I was fully prepared to switch over to notebook.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,David Swatosh,Constant crashing while in the middle of tracking a workout. Very frustrating! Especially for a paid app. Better of using BodySpace.,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Nick Damato,After update app still crashes just not as frequently.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,felipe ortiz,Work outs are great but app keeps stopping on the middle of the workout I'm on test period and thinking no to go thru with it if keep doing it,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Michael Brunick,"Updating my review since the developer team fixed the bug that u originally rated on. Generally enjoy the app, and it's gui. The only additional update I would recommend is being able to see the history of lifts that are linked together in supersets.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Miguel Hernandez,The last update broke the timer functionality whenever the app is in the background. I have contacted the developer but got no response. Will update my review whenever this is fixed. Edit: The bug has been fixed and now the app works as expected.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Manuel Tapia,Love the app except for the fact it crashes every time my screen locks during a set or I change windows so I have to continuously keep my screen open to not lose my day's data/timer. I would more than likely rate 5 stars if it wasn't for this annoyance.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,rohan tiwari,Have been subscribed and using the app for a few years now. Had absolutely no issues until recently. Workouts come with a rest timer that pings once the rest is over. Recently the app has started crashing if you use the rest timer. It would crash as soon as the phone screen goes off. Highly inconvenient. Hopefully it's a temporary issue. Update: issue fixed after a recent update.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jeff Balascak,App crashes every time you lock your phone,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Salomon Baeza,"It keeps closing and kicking me out please fiztor I'll be forced yo stop subscription Update. Don't let the timer run and it seems to work. Just press ""x"" on it",1

Frequently logged out of the app. Log back in and poof your workout for the day that you were in the middle of tracking is zeroed out. App crashes 30+ times in an hour and a half workout session. Every time you switch apps, set phone down, or do anything else the app crashes and you need to go back into the app, it asks me to continue logging, hit yes, and most of the workout is still in place... Until it crashes and logs you out and you lose it all",1
com.bodybuilding.rise,Utkarsh Jain,The app crashes everytime I lock the phone. This makes the app unusable.,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jorel Ferguson,The app keeps restarting if you jump to another app which is really annoying. The also has frequently experience server issues which delays you workout which make you not want to use the app. It would be great if these things wouldn't happen,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Kyle Koppenhoefer,"Recently, the app has started crashes 20 or 30 times during a 1 hour workout.",1

Today I can't even get in to log my workouts or look at what I was suppose to do today. Update: App constantly crashes.

com.bodybuilding.rise,Jacob McCall,Great app for beginners or people w/o time to research or prepare workout plans.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Aaron Ransom,Not bad. Great for workout log and some of the best workouts I've done. Rest timer needs some work....occasionally doesn't sound off or sounds off 15 sec late. Other then that one solid app.,4

com.bodybuilding.rise,Emma Cound,"Love having this app to time rests and record every set. Keeps me on track and is a big motivator because I can focus on one exercise at a time and simply follow the programme. Anything I don't know, I just watch the video to refresh my memory and check form.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Karl Dalton,This app only has bro splits of different types. There is no variation in training methods. Extremely outdated. Am now locked into a year after I got halfway through a program and realised that all the programs are the same. It's also very difficult to track weights week by week meaning it is of almost no use in the gym. Was hoping for an app that at least made it easy to track what have lifted before but there are better ones out there for free.,1

com.bodybuilding.rise,Jakoby Mallory,"The App would be 5 stars but there are some areas that definitely need to be improved: 1. This App and the bodyspace app should have the same workouts/Naming on both platforms. When i want to change a exercise, its difficult to find. i still use the bodyspace app because it does a better job of tracking my workout areas and its easier to alter my workouts 2. This app doesn't allow you to add exercises to a plan. I would like to track the exercises i do outside of the planned workout.",3

com.bodybuilding.rise,Joanne Frye,I really like the app but for some reason brings up an error sign in the middle of my workout and I have to close the app and open it again very annoying and takes away from my time.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Joe Cina,"Great app overall just done things I would change. Number 1, if you swap out an exercise for another in a program it didn't save that exercise for next round and also the exercise video never updates to the new exercise. You're not able to swap exercises on supersets, which is very annoying if you don't have the equipment. I would like to be able to create my own daily workout from time to time as well! Lastly just a little thing here but a buzzer at the end of the rest would be nice touch.",4

Cons: 1. app inconsistent with tracking workouts. 2. app does not save workout if more than one exercise is subbed out. Not all gyms are created equal 3. inability to design your own personalized workout. 4. As well when you select a single day workout the app will not allow you to sub out excercise that are different, for example adductor/groin for a sumo deadlift. Fix these asap",3

com.bodybuilding.rise,Ben Smith,"I love the workout programs and the videos for them. My only gripe is that it has an issue with tracking my workout.

com.bodybuilding.rise,L Boogie,I love this app.,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,Alexander Farmer,The app is good if your getting back in the gym and need basic guidance and nutritional information. I've always enjoyed the Stopanni routines. However the app is terrible at helping you track your work out weights and will lose your workout data if you dont complete and load back to the dashboard. Left then right workouts dont keep your weight history or allow you to keep notes. Left and right workouts also dont allow adding additional sets if doing drop sets.,3

com.bodybuilding.rise,Rob Norman,I really like the app and workout tracking and videos are really helpful. I did notice a bug in the weight progression which I think is related to imperial vs metric. Trainer says to increase by 5-10 pounds but the app increased the weight by 10kgs. Definitely not the same thing :),3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Michael Fanta,Great app,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Debi Clark,"Great app but when doing supersets it doesn't let you into history. You have to continually come out of your workout plan to go into your exercise history to see your last weight etc, this is very frustrating as it interrupts your flow.",5

com.bodybuilding.rise,Brandon Kingston,"There are exercises it doesn't track, the estimated weight ranges from cycle to cycle/month to month are unrealistic.

com.bodybuilding.rise,Stephanie Horne,"I have used this app for years and definitely works great, if you know what you are doing or have help. Was a little mad when they started charging but I get it. Only thing I have to complain about is when you are on the dashboard part and you have your plans that you choose, it is hard to tell what plan is what. They need to be labeled.

com.bodybuilding.rise,Dustyn Godfrey,Absolutely worth the money,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Richard Campbell,Four stars only because the videos freeze and you have to restart them which messes with your workout some. Other than that it's a really really great app and makes getting in shape or get back in shape after that COVID 20 way easier. Meal plans and sup guides are always helpful at least as a guide to help in your fitness journey. If you want a personal trainer but can't afford one or you are like me and just hate the gym this is for you.,4

There were a couple things missing: 1) an auditory signal for the rest timer. 2) the ability to pre-schedule workouts into the calendar. 3) the ability to mark ""favorite"" workouts. 4) the ability to edit or replace exercises",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Wienez,I love this app. But! It would be perfect if you could edit/substitute certain machine/lifts that aren't available to you for an alternative. Also add lifts if you want to keep going at the end of a workout plan. Please acknowledge this. It would be huge,4

com.bodybuilding.rise,Kavi Oblitus-anima,Very useful for tracking workouts if a bit simplistic. Shows you how much you lifted in a session which can be a huge ego boost after a hard workout,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,Terrence Johnson,Great app. Super easy to stay focused and on task due to the option to track your workout.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jeri Edwards,"The customer support is amazing, and that alone earns 5 stars. There are some flaws in the app itself, but overall this is my go to fitness app. Wishes for the app: to be able to review previously recorded weight history in supersets and triple sets like you can in single set settings. They are aware this would be helpful, but haven't been able to fix it in almost a year. Also wish you could create your own schedule to follow using the single workouts at times.",4

com.bodybuilding.rise,Tanya E,"This is the only fitness app that motivates me to get to the gym at 5am, knowing I don't have to put together a plan. Pick a workout routine based on goals equipment and time allowance and start tracking. On some rest days I just choose a muscle area I want to focus on, equipment and amount of time I have to spend and I have a one time workout routine. Been using this for about a year now and without it I wouldn't be getting up still excited to crush goals! Good luck fitfam!",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Amanda Schmitt,Great,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Lucas Trestka,"Great app for tracking. The only criticism I have is with the rest timers, which automatically turn off and go away if you go back to your previous set to make a change. I think a manual trigger to end the timer, or the ability to restart it would be nice.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,LakeciaA MacLak,Great workouts and easy to follow with how to videos. Also simple way to track progress.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Sean Monks,The app is great and well worth the money. For the price of 1 month gym membership you have access to so many programs that make it easy to find a routine for you,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,Stevensingh95,I am going to change my review. I got some extra money recently from going to a wedding. With the home gym I built in my garage I decided to buy a subscription. It was the best 50$ I spend. I did my first workout today. And it was much easier than spending it in a actual gym. I hope to do my 6 week transformation with this service. 💪,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,Michael Leslie,"So close to being great. There are a few missing features that keep this app from being great: - Past history only sometimes shows up - No way to look up past history outside of workout - Occasionally the work out doesn't save at all That said, I'm keeping my subscription for now.",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Max Perkins,Programs are good but this app performance isn't the best. Videos buffer about 10 min at a time which requires me to restart after the lag out. Tried it on data and wifi and on different phone and still present. Do not have this issue on computer from the web. Really interrupts the user experience.,2

com.bodybuilding.rise,Erika Gould,"Nice that it has a lot of plans. Plus the savings through BodySpace. I don't like that I can't build my own workout plan or even swap exercises when I'm following a plan. BodySpace app has that, so I use that when I need to. But this one being paid for, should offer what BodySpace app has plus more. Will get 5 stars when those are worked in.",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,Micah Sleeper,Just all around terrible work out app. The way it tracks exercises involves way to much clicking rather than timed. Constantly have to look at next exercise. Way to much going on. Need to simplify...,1

com.bodybuilding.rise,Ghazi Ahmad,Excellent app,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Jeff DiJerome,"Horrible, they took my money for a 1 year subscription and then deactivated my account after the first week. To make things worse, no customer service.

com.bodybuilding.rise,camilo calvete,Best app ever really nice workouts,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Constantine Koby,Great app. If you will add exercise history in SUPERSET exercises I'll change it to 5 star. Need to go out from workout to check history for exercises which are part of superset. Other than that I love this app.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,Shonda Dean,Not like BodySpace which I like better.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,David Lloyd,"I enjoy this app and use it regularly, but I think it'd be even better if workouts can be favorited/ saved for later on a list so that they can be accessed easier and done whenever",5

com.bodybuilding.rise,Michael Onystok,I used BodySpace for 10 years. This is a great improvement for the professional workout plans.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Patrick Conwell,Excellent app. The workouts and information available are all the best of any workout app I've used. There are two UI additions you need. 1) Night mode (an hour workout with the white screen on drains at least 30% of my battery) 2) Simple but huge. Add a bell sound when the rest timer ends. I like to zone in-between sets and without this bell I have to keep my screen on and stare at the phone to know when to begin the next set. I'll turn this to 5 star as soon as you have this.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,zabeh hakimzada,ZAEBH,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Uvashen Ramlall,Would do for the intermediate trainer. Has quite a few different training regimes and the logging helps to keep you disciplined. I'm not quite sure if it's worth the penny though as you can get these from a qualified Personal Trainer at a lower cost.,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,Bryan B.,Built in timers are nice. But how it tracks prior exercise history is poor and not user friendly. A note feature is super nice yet how to access them easily? App needs a lot of work on interface / ease of use,3

com.bodybuilding.rise,Sean Mallery,Want an app that signs you out in the gym? This is the one. Won't let you log back in mid workout. Yeah!,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,mynameisadam665,"Hilariously bad. Needed a workout program that focused solely on dumb bells and found a pretty good looking one. The app wouldn't let me log my reps or weights, just said to do the exercises for 20 seconds each... What?? No weight auto incrementing, no workout history, no progress graphs. And the cherry on top was that the only dumb bell program I could find asked for things like kettle bells and barbells later on. Not even any option to replace workouts. Super disappointing app.",1

com.bodybuilding.rise,Scott Cornett,"An okay app. Using workout programs such as Jim Stoppani's Shortcut to Size, certain exercises don't allow to add notes, keep history or add additional sets.

com.bodybuilding.rise,Gerard Woods,The upgrade to app has been unreal,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Christina Kriebel,Great interface and price for all the plans is just 7 bucks a month? That's a steal. Currently dong a kettlebell workout at home and it's short and sweet and I still feel it. Have previously done the Uplifted plan at a gym and loved it. But I am moving away from gyms so I want something at home. BodyFit is the best personal trainer!!,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,Humungus -,This app really is poorly thought out. My biggest complaints are 1 the weight that you used on the last exercise don't transfer over to the new week. So you'll have to exit out of your current week go back to the last week to find it. 2nd for some unknown reason the timer on this app doesn't make any noise.,1

I realized i was finding excuses. My fitness is my responsibility and the truth is, the content and guidance is amazing. The workouts have me sweating n walking on cloud 9. It is amazing when u get over the excuses.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,Kimberly TC,"The app has potential but is lacking in comparison to some of the other competitors in terms of functionality. The choice of plans and depth is great however; 1. The timing when tracking your workouts needs to be automated and sounded like the video versions. 2. If the full workout is available for the workout then this should also automatically track the workout, I have to remember to manually complete. 3.The video consistently crashes when playing, atleast 3 times this is annoying.

com.bodybuilding.rise,Robert Baxley,"After a long day at work or early in the morning it really helps having such a well structured program. Either the coffee hasn't hit yet or its worn off which is what makes the app shine. There's no thinking involved, or at least its not required. Just rack it up and go. It has helped me push out of a standard routine I had as well and shows you the correct way to accomplish the exercises, all for less than the price of a pack of smokes or a value meal per month.",5

The one flaw which is a major one to is being able to see what weight I was living on a particular exercise.

Plenty of good comments here and all are accurate. I'm just sour that it's become a subscription and I have to pay money for something that used to be free.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Advertised as a free fitness app in the marketplace; only option is to pay a monthly or yearly price for literally any of the workout plans. Way too many apps that are actually free. I think this should be more upfront about being a paid app instead of displaying itself as free and then requiring payment to do literally anything after signing up/signing in.,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"I love this app, there's a couple of programs on here that are transformative.

Umm still no search button within the app,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Solid workouts, app is messy. For the first set, it features a timer for the set. The second set is preset to your prior time, so you can't time yourself while you do it. If you clear the times, another stopwatch comes up, a fullscreen one that tells you how long you should work, but it only lets you put in one set. And you lose the number of sets in the routine (and the rest time) if you use it.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"I love this app even though it can be a little clunky. The reason is because It does everything I need it to. A few annoyances are that in supersets you can't add notes or see your weight history and when you are entering your weight/reps there are two options to hit ""complete"" except one takes you back a screen and forgets the data you just entered. It's also just a little non-intuitive for me overall. But that said thes are minor when compared to it's functionality. The programs are top notch!",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,It's an amazing app. There are however a few issues. I wish I could read all the articles that is online on my app as well. There is also a bit of an error when doing more than 1 timed set where there is no button to start the timer only an option to complete but the workouts are fantastic. I use to be very fit and competed on a professional level. These last few years I've not been training and I feel like this app will get me back on track,4

All my workouts have been successfully logged EXCEPT Leg Day workouts. I am on the 5th week of the program and I cannot see what my Leg Day workout was from the previous 4 weeks! I can see all the previous workouts (Chest & Biceps Day, Back Day, etc.). Because of this bug, essentially what I do on Leg Day is trying to recall what last week's weights were and go from there.

I canceled on day one that the subscription started, and requested a refund since it is almost $100 for 1 year. They were unable to understand and refused to give me a refund. They also had the nerve to tell me that as a subscriber, I get 10% off purchases. Why would I spend more money through a company that doesn't understand its customers. Very disappointed.",1

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Issues with logging workouts. It saved my workout ""locally"" and wouldn't apply the results to my profile for tracking progress. Sent an email to try to help correct the issue. In the process of trying to fix it myself, I managed to erase the local data, marking a generic completion of the workout with no other information. (Now I cant track my progress unless I write it down outside of the app) definitely need this fixed if I'm going to keep paying as a BodyFit Elite member.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Really underestimated the benefit of the workout tracker.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,I used to use BodySpace (BB's last app and switched over to BodyFit. I like that BodyFit has the full complement of workout programs that yiu can find online! However you can't track previous workouts so you can't track your progress nor quickly reference how much weight you lifted last time. BodySpace was better cuz it easily showed you your progress right in the middle of your current work out. So there no point to entering your current workouts since it just gets lost. Lame,2

One annoying thing that I would ask to be changed is at the bottom of each exercise, either move or change the ""next exercise"" button. It's frustrating to finish a set, and instead of hitting ""save and start rest timer"" I hit ""next exercise"" because it's a permanent button, whereas ""save and start rest timer"" sometimes requires you to scroll down.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Overall pretty satisfied. I have been having issues in the past in terms of weight randomly not saving, or app freezing (freezing issue seems more frequent) but overall I feel it's pretty solid.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,As a bodybuilder this app is actually bad. Misinformation and poor training methods by people not in as good of shape as me.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Would like an interval timer integral with the app aswell as macronutrient tracker. The work out program I'm doing requires both and I needed 2 more apps to have the full experience. Other than that the app it's self is well set up just needs a few extra perks.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"I really liked this app for the first week or so. Then it lost my tracked data from previous workouts & crashed during workouts. On one occasion, during a workout, it lost all the data from previous sets and even kicked me out.

I then found out it had activated a second subscription and it double charged me two months in a row. NOT WORTH THE INSTABILITY. 🤬",1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Not what I expected. Only allows you to use a plan and not search exercises.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Great app and tons of different styles of workout. There is so much content that anyone can benefit from it no matter their goal.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,So far so good.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Some of the videos will freeze and you need to fast forward to a spot that isn't frozen. It's super frustrating when you're in your groove and then lose momentum.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Great app for consistently tracking and training fir weightlifting . Does have/Integrate some HIIT programs as well.,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,It easy to use and makes working out great,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Overall the app js great. Im able to keep my workouts consistent and the app does a great job of keeping me in track. However, the weird thing with the app is that it ""refreshes"" and needs to be loaded again durong the middle of my workouts. Im more than happy to explain via email if the dev/product teams need more clarity",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,I LOVE Hannah Edens wirkouts! Soooo worth the work! Well thought out. Best program I have ever done!!#!,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Hey I have download this app 1 week ago  then I could not find the workout for myself then I was looking for unsubscribe the plans but I could not find the button! so I uninstall the app an today my debit for my account without notifications! Kindly please help me out an give my money back ! Is big trouble for me ! Regret sanjay .,3

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Love it, easy to use!",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Very simple and effective.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Makes me feel like a BEAST...,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Average.. I feel as though for a subscription the quality could be better. I love that you can track your workout and log details about eac exercise, but I think the app could do more for tracking your time instead of relying on another device. Also, if I need to see form and go to the 'Overview' of an exercise it interrupts Spotify audio. I'm pretty sure the audio isn't necessarily essential in seeing what the exercise is. I know that just a small update could help this app run seamlessly.",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"The highest recommended workout for me was terrible. 90% of the time it would say to do 4 round of sets and it would only allow you to track 1 round and then after that you just had to do the other rounds without entering them. This may not be an issue for everyone but the reason I wanted to use the app was for the satisfaction of tracking all my reps, it is a mental thing for me. You cannot manually add the workouts either once you pick a plan. The plan I was using is Total Fitness with Andy Speer. I will be trying to find a new application for my workouts that will actually allow me to track all my reps.",1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Loving this app, something feels like it's missing I'm not sure what, so I'm also looking forward to it's evolution.",5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Can not log in!!!!!!!! What should I do,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"So far so good. Some minor adjustments would make it great. Ex being able to input the bar weight (barbell, curl bar) as well as being able to adjust the rest timer. Last and not least once the timer is done having some kind of alert noise or tone that makes me knw the timer is up. Outside of that, it great.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Downloaded the app so far so good, having a little bit of trouble tracking workouts with the times but that just might be me that doesnt know how to properly set it, other than than I love the app",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Hannah eden is a fire goddess 🔥🔥✨,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,This is a really great fitness app. I have been using it for a while now. I absolutely love it. My only problem is that only the first sets of each exercise have the built-in timer. The subsequent sets do not have a timer and only display the time spent on the first set of each exercise. I hope this can be addressed.,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,makes tracking your workouts so simple,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"this app is very helpful, but the only thing that i didn't like is that the workout program on the website is not the same as in this app, for example i opened the same week and same day on both the app and the website and the app was missing a cardio and abs workout after the weight lifting, so i am confused which one is the right one",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"One of the best fitness apps I've personally used. From nutrition, to videos of excercises down to tracking weight reps and effort. Makes it super simple to make hard earned gains. Well worth the money.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"at first its confusing, you just have to explore everything. After that everything went well. I suggest you also have to give option multiple acc for personal trainers to use",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Not bad, however everything is internet depended and slow boot everytime you launch it",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,I like the way this app is all in one. Makes it real easy to track performance and progress. Easier to hold yourself accountable.,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Love the variety and the clear information on how to properly so exercises,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,If you by accident touch another exercise timer is reset!!! it doesn't let you adjust the rest in between reps. the notification for timer remains even when you start a new rep. doesn't show notes. it should let me choose alternative exercise if the one mentioned is not accessible for me. - If you add 2 extra sets it doesn't give you resting timer in between. there are no timers between the last set of current exercise and the first set of the next exercise. the nutrition plan is very vague.,3
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Ita amazing,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Love it. Wish it had its own food tracker,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,can't contact the developer as they only accept emails from within their own company.,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"11 weeks into the app and feel it's been worth the money spent. A good variety of programs to choose from and the support you get in the Facebook community is awesome. A few things i wish that could be different: if you try to edit a prior set while the rest timer is running you lose the timer, wish if you switched an exercise for another it stayed switched for the program, wish the suggested weight for a lift was your prior workout weight. Minor issues, but not enough to drop it from 5 stars.",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Don't waste your time with the app or the website! Doesn't save notes. completely non-intuitive, doesn't really follow the workout. Do not waste your time or money with this website or this app. 22 hours of back and forth with the app developer. Bottom line, the application is flawed. The workout shoe keep track of on your smartphone do not sync with the website. but you have to pay $12.95 a month for the website in order to use the app which doesn't communicate with the website. Genius!",1

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"A few tweeks and this app would be perfect. First, this app needs an offline mode. When I travel internationally, my access to my workout is compromised.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,This app is extremely frustrating. If you switch between apps during the workout it restarts/logs out then back in . no other apps do this. by comparison the fee bodyspace app works far better. for a subscription app its not very good.,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,cant subscribe my bank is not eligible for payment,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,I hate this app! I've been trying to unsubscribe to it for a few months and keep getting the run around! the app does not work at times due to buffering. i have tried calling on numerous occasions the actual body building store to cancel but they say they dont know how. they told me to contact google play but when I emailed them I got a automated system message stating I have the wrong address!! this is the most inconsistent inconvenience I've ever had!!!!! I want my money back now!!,1

Calendar doesn't show all workouts. Website then shows no workouts tracked!? I subscribed to a plan and ended up copying it and doing my own tracking in google sheets (with sheets app),2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,This app is AWESOME! For years I use to print off my workouts and write them all down. It is so much easier tor track everything through your phone! Your workouts are planned out on a daily basis and you even have a rest timer! This app kicks BUTT!,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,love it,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Worth it! The cost of a subscription is well worth it to me. It's like having a personal trainer giving me my workouts based on science and proven results. And I've gotten great results myself out of the programs I've followed.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Really bad app, tracked workouts missing, regularly opening the app halfway through my workout to tell me that I've 'Skipped workout' When I go back to update my workout, it will let me enter my reps and sets but the 'update workout' button doesn't work.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,keeps me focused and on track. An absolute must for people who need some direction with fitness and adequate for people who are advanced to track lifts.,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"good programs with detailed steps on there. the tracker is pretty good, if you're following a program that increases the weight per week thenthe tracker automatically increase it for you but that can be hit-or-miss. The sets populate automatically but not if you have a extra drop set included, so it's not perfect. also you can't change the rest time which is my biggest gripe. But overall very good.",5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"The app is nice but there a few few large flaws. You drop sets are jot able to be tracked properly (as they are in Bodyspace). I haven't figured out how to delete a set, nor have I found how to swap exercises so things can be tracked properly. The total time for the workout should also be available at the end of the workout without having to look at your history. I still much prefer Bodyspace after trying this app for tie last week.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Love this App. Good programs for anyone whether your a beginner or just looking for something new to keep you on your toes. Recommend this for anyone. You also get discounts ordering from their store if you pay for the subscription. It's worth it.,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"When it works, the app is good for finding workouts, examples and keeping a log with current plans. The online only feature really is lame. If you have a poor signal then the app will not load your history. Sometimes, regardless of signal, I get logged out. The fix for me is to close the app and open it back up. My app restarts the track workout feature a lot. There are also segments in the Big Man on Campus workout that will not track correctly and even skips whole sets. Frustrating experience.",2

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,pretty awesome app for all the access for workouts. makes a workout more structured and fun,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,I hate this app. I'm forced to use it because it has my favorite plan but it's garbage. 1. Most of the time my workouts don't end up getting tracked even though I enter all of the info. This is very annoying when I want to look back to track progress. 2. Rest timer was a nice addition for those looking for it but a just a PITA for everyone else. What was the point in locking the next set? All you've done is added another button that I have to press... 3. The UI sucks and is not intuitive.,1

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"The best app I've seen thus far! Just knowing I have this app makese want to workout all the time, although my work schedule does not always permit me to exercise as often as I would like. Everything about the workouts amd other plans is motivatonal, but what i like most is how the trainers make it look so fun; in hindside it is fun working out with you. Keep up the good work, guys!",5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Used to get some of these workouts for free. Thought I'd try using them again but all plan options are way too pricey. And why does everything always have to based on the subscription pricing model?,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,This is the heir to BodySpace and it is well on its way. It is still under development but already has so many of the features (and less of the bugs) that made BodySpace so great. Can't wait to see future updates!

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Perfect for tracking and following your chosen routine. Plenty to choose from so can't fault it. Only thing I'd change is the weight tracker from pounds to kilos but perhaps it's just a setting i haven't looked for. Great app!,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"This app is poorly designed. I'm considering canceling my monthy subscription and using a different company/app all together. The information and programs are great, it is the mobile app I keep having issues with. The app will let you log an entire workout, then when you submit it , it logs a skipped day instead. All data erased. If you skip rest day before or after a workout it will again delete that days data. I'm not sure why you would have to delete and redownload an app for it to work.",1

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"I really enjoy the app so far. This is my 3rd week using it. I love that I can go to the gym with a plan and not feel lost in there. The only downside to it is that I wish they could give me alternate workouts in case my gym doesn't have that particular machine. Overall, I'm really enjoying ising the app. I'm pretty new to working out and using the workout plan on here makes me feel like I actually know what I'm doing in there.",4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Exceptional,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"It's ridiculous how long this app takes to load. It resets if you go off the app and then takes ages to re load. Can you not make it so that the workouts are downloaded and stored locally so there is no need to contact a server? Good content, but won't carry on paying unless it's vastly improved.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,great,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,The app has improved a lot but it still needs more beginner workouts for the actual gym and women. If I wanted to work out at home I'd pay for Beach Body app. I enjoy lifting but most of the programs are geared toward hard core shreds. Many also lack abdominal training...And the diet plans are vague and contradictory....not well thought out.,3

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Decent interface - usable while working out. Pricey, but gives you everything you need to faithfully complete the specific workout you choose, at your fingertips. Set timer and notes area nice updates (near perfect workout app! add ability to adjust rest-time, and a carry-forward on notes, like how the weight pre-fills from last workout - and it's there :) Pricey, but worth the time savings and ability to attack challenging programs designed by experienced trainers.",5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,So I was super excited to start Hannah Eden's FYR program but the app is not chrome cast compatiable so can't watch and hear her motivation during workouts. Tried the timer but it does not annouce what moves are next so constantly having to stop working out to check and it does not even move on automatically to the new move you have to save and continue. the timer does not even go off when the 30s is up dead silent. seems like if you are in this for the video at home programs not the best app.,2

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Seems great on the surface but does not seem to be anyway to manually add your own workout routine or make additions or subtractions to programmed exercises. A couple glitches with workout by Bill Phillip's that says to do 5 circuits but only allows you to enter 1 circuit. Too much money for not ha ing manual adjustments or ability to manage and track your own routine. Very dissappointed :-(,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Had an issue with the app loading. Uninstalled the app and no fix. Restarted my phone and that seemed to fix the issue. Been great otherwise.,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,I cannot add more than two sets. this app is confusing and frustrating,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Since the recent update I can no longer enter in my sets until the rest timer is up. I don't have a lot of time normally to exercise so I would do supersets or cut the rest short which means I can't enter my set weights after I complete them now. I'm going to end up forgetting what weight/rep I used by the time I am able to enter the set. App is very good otherwise. EDIT: if I press the ""x"" on the rest timer I can skip it and enter the next set. It was much easier when I didn't have to do that",4

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"The old method of asking for credit card and financial information for a ""free trial"" is just dishonest in my opinion. Let us have the free trial, and if we decide we don't like it and uninstall the app, we won't risk getting charged unnecessarily. It's a slimy way to swipe $9 off of unsuspecting people.",1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,extremely helpful!!! worth every penny spent!!,5
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Not free at all. Dont even bother wasting time creating an account unless youre willing to pay monthly/annually. Cant even get past the hostage style tactic to explore what the app offers without pulling out a credit card first. Terribly misleading - hope PlayStore will rescend the Free listing to display as the amount required to pay. Bad experience and waste of my time.,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,can't believe you have to subscribe and pay for this app! Why would I want to do that when you have so many other free ones that offer the same thing! ridiculous! you need to be upfront from beginning and tell people from the start that you need to pay for this app! it's not even a one-off payment it's continuous! the upfront from the beginning about having to pay! and wasting people's time!,1

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"This app is great, it keeps me motivated to workout and it keeps track of my progress. The only thing I don't like is that there's a lot of back and forth between pages to get to the workout.",4

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"I'll give yall 2 stars cause im pretty sure yall have an amazing workout plan but yall should offer a free version very minimal content as in you get a basic arm, leg, shoulder,back workout and no tips from yalls staff and thats all you get unless you pay. You would still have access to the store but thered be no discounts or anything that a paying customer would have. It would really help college students cause I myself am in college and everyone knows money is tight i college. Hope that helped",2

I wish the meal plans were a little more detailed - every day is the same.

Overall, would recommend.",4

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"In my brief experience this isn't a user friendly app. It took me 10 minutes to create an account after continuously getting ""Invalid Password"" popups with no further details like PW requirements. Then I find out I have to pay 8.99/month. That seems quite excessive considering the amount of free resources available and the poor (though brief) user experience I had when signing up.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Pros - Easy workout tracking - Quick access to full plans - Can track multiple plans simultaneously - Calendar shows tracked workouts and weights lifted - when tracking a lift the weight you used last time you did the same lift autopopulates Cons - Lack of flexibility (Cant substitute exercises in a program or enter your own workouts into tracker) - Doesn't sync with bodyspace - Tracking progress could be made easier (no charts or stats on weight increase in lifts etc),4

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Something weird has been going on with the app. I'm unable to login into my account through the app but I am able to on a web browser. If someone could help me figure this out I would appreciate it.,2

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Great programs but the workout logging app side needs work. No timers; return from videos requires shutting application down. Only plus side to some issues is the auto saving of your progress. Update Feb. 2, 2019 - Some trackingis better; still need a back from video screen, rest timers (must have), and need to have the program tell the user what load to do this time (weight /reps / time) . Update: So far all issues fixed. Thanks but still need a rest timer function.",4

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Personal data mining app. Their terms and and privacy policy give nearly unlimited access to your private data to sell to others and bombard you with ads. I'd GLADLY pay for an app that wasn't a rights-grabber and data miner. The subscription offer doesn't appear intil after you give up all rights.

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"I couldnt get into the app at all, I sign up and log in and it takes me to the subscription page and forced me to choose a subscription. in the description below the the two subscriptions it states any unused free trial period is forfeited the moment you purchase a subscription. so not buying a subscription to something that supposedly offers a free trial that I cant access and lose the freedom trial period from minute one when forced to buy something",1

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"it's not a bad app. i use it because that's the easiest way to look at the workouts for the program I'm doing. it allows you to track your workout but it'll remember the last one. there's is no history which makes the tracking idiotic. example, if i do chest press 10 reps i use 140, then another day i need to do chest 5 reps 160. if i need to know how much i did for 10 i have no way of knowing because it will remember the 5 rep one. i wish it had the same tracking feature as body space.",3

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Worst app then the free version. plus most of this content used to be free. app runs slow also. not worth it at all to me.,1

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Straight forward app to use.... when it works. Had it for 3 days now, 1st day of workout out videos didnt play. Day 3 the app won't open. Not worth the monthly subscription if I have to keep finding work around for a workout program. Doesn't give detailed workout advice such as proper technique. And app doesnt give alternate workouts only online webpage does.",2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Nice app,4
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Not sure why I'd pay for these workout plans when bodyspace has plenty of amazing and free workouts already. But I'll give it a try at least. I like it so far.,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Not the best. I was really hoping and expecting to be able to stream the videos within the app to Chromecast but after contacting their support team, no helpful solution was offered. I'm on the 7 day free trial and won't be renewing because of this.",3

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,Good,5

com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Haven't used very long, but great plans. Extremely disappointed that workouts aren't able to cast or air played within the app. Whose managing Customer Experience. No replies to reviews that they're working on improving app. Diaappointing 😥",3
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,NOT All Access. Doesn't include most fitness plans. Save time and just go to the Bodybuilding website on your phone browser and access your workouts there. This app most likely won't have them.,2
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,This a waste app.. could be a fraudulent one,1
com.bodybuilding.rise,A Google user,"Great app content wise, but keeps crashing on startup. It is not a free app so this is quite annoying and distracting when you are at gym.",3
