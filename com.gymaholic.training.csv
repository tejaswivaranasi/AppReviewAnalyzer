com.gymaholic.training,Kate Haro Suyom,"So far so good, App is what I really specifically needed. Functions are well, just a bit of problem with the bug going on with the Saved Custom Personalized Workouts & the lag when performing/clicking Options, Or when Operating. Glad I found this app. Looking furthur for more features & improvements. Hoping that the Admins would be accomodating, since this is the first time I made a feedback to this app. Loved this, Highly Recommended for fellow fitness enthusiasts!",5
com.gymaholic.training,A K,"Gymaholic has come a long way since it's days on Tumblr and has always been old reliable to me. Whenever I quit the latest ig trainers membership programs, I know I can always get back on track on either the app or the website. There are so many programs with various levels with a ton of extra workouts on the side. I really hope these guys get the recognition and popularity they deserve.",5
com.gymaholic.training,Lorand Condrache,"It's very slow. Every time i opened the app and went to the ""created"" workout a new one would appear (out of the blue). After creating a workout and completing it, it would disappear from the ""created"" section and move directly to ""history"" (why would i want that?? I want to workout tomorrow as well) Moving to another phone doesn't store/sync the data (what use does the account has if this basic function is not there?)",1
com.gymaholic.training,Stacey Jobson,Terrible app never works,1
com.gymaholic.training,Georgette Murillo,I paid for the premium and everything was going great until the videos and timers stopped working. Deleting app and unsubscribing.,1
com.gymaholic.training,Thembile Shazi,I love this app! The only problem is some exercises are not demonstrated but I mean...I usually know those but still...,4
com.gymaholic.training,Douglas,Not easy to use. Everything behind a pay wall. Not user friendly. A waste of data and the devs who made this dont understand the principle of kiss. Keep it simple stupid. They r just stupid... but its behind a pay wall and its not user friendly. Cash grab pos. Burn this app. The device can go to hell,1
com.gymaholic.training,Stefan Panov,Excellent App. Developer is friendly and answers all my concerns.,5
com.gymaholic.training,Mary Koundouri,"Very glitchy/buggy, not very user-friendly and I ended up completely uninstalling because the app would just crash and not even start.",2
com.gymaholic.training,Danie Du Toit,"Looks good, developer fixed the issue I faced quickly.",5
com.gymaholic.training,Donny,"I find the app to buggy and to much of a pain to set up. It is way easier just to keep track of the exercise, weight, sets, reps, etc on my phone notes app.",1
com.gymaholic.training,Scott Mc,"Deleted within seconds after it gave me the option to ""tone up."" Nonsensical term, doesn't apply to strength or fitness training.",1
com.gymaholic.training,Alex V,Can't add unlisted exercises. What is the point of this app?,1
com.gymaholic.training,Joshuwa Bolton,"The pitch is your able to create own plans and track them for free. Not the case, requires monthly subscription to use. Pen and paper is cheaper.",1

com.gymaholic.training,Denise Rogers,Been trying to cancel premium subscription. App just keeps going in circles... Sign in with email... Doesn't work so it tells me to sign in with Facebook. That doesn't work so it tells me to sign in with email. Then Facebook. I never did get all of the premium features. I'm thinking it's a big scam!,1
com.gymaholic.training,Dilute Oxygen,"Doesn't let you access most of the plans if you don't have premium, Like the 5-Day Workout. Edit: But the same plans are available on your website for free, why not here too? I have to go through the hassle of searching for each exercise video when I'm on my phone.",2

com.gymaholic.training,A Google user,"I really like the options and customization, but unfortunately I am not a fan of the constant crashing when I add a workout, or once I'm in the middle of a workout it freezes and cannot be fixed until I force stop the app and open again. This freezing happened twice during a single workout and I just stopped the workout entirely and lost motivation. I hope this can all get fixed because I really wanna stick to this app!",2

com.gymaholic.training,A Google user,"Love this app, the work outs and plans and the interface. It has some glitches and issues after a patch but I contacted support they reverted to an earlier version and got it working again. Support was extremely helpful and even sent me the workout I was supposed to do on a day when I couldn't access the app. I would give it 5 stars if it worked all the time as intended but it's my favorite work out planning app for sure.",4
